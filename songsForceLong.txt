Verse 1:
You see your own ass on the set
No matter what it is
Got yourself a couple of racks
Don't fuck with another hoe
Keep a few racks, we don't really care about
We just fucking make friends, get high off that rock star
Cause when you look like J. Cole
If you tryna play that one with me, I'm gonna lose my mind
I will not fall in love
I be on a mission
Yeah yeah I’m on a mission
Yeah yeah I got time for me to do it again
This for the fans so lets go and listen to music live
And don't wanna hear them fuckin', fuck around and
But if we can start right now, then we could start livin' life together
So let's sit back with these motherfuckers who claim to be great at rap
I want to tell the truth about Rap, this is not a dream or an adventure
It will always end up as a lie if you lied to yourself
So you're never gonna have the time to sleep
If there's one thing I can say
Aye, before I start feeling insecure
Listen, let me ask myself why I'm so insecure
There's something I just can't explain

All of my niggas work hard
Get money everyday (money everyday)
Get money everyday (you know)
Get money everyday (right here)
What they talkin' 'bout? Let's talk about 'bout nothin' (nothin')
They ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
Verse 2:
I used to get in trouble and it happened to way too many rappers
Bammit it was just that simple fact that made my mom feel I had no real life
I used to get lost in the mix while I thought I'd found out that these bars are actually kinda dangerous
I used to know they gon beat him, but nowadays I gotta chase his sound
Told them you'll probably never find a rhyme, so you better take the chance
This for everyone that wants to show loyalty
But that doesn't make these rhymes fun
Cause after all they been through the fight with the beat
Nigga, come back and stay strong
We can bring a revolution if it's gonna work right

Verse 2:
Yeah, everybody knew me so right back then …Now they used to say that I was never ready
But when I met one of them, he seemed like he should've known

Verse 1:
It's hard when everything always beats, how you tell your friends to play with each other?
The same way you'll run through a party even without you getting too old to have an inkling of something
You better get up and get a pen before you finish, or you'll be on your own and start writing all these songs. And the ones who make up the whole game, they write about them so why not write on their own?
Let's tell you something for yourself! You like it better than this! It's a different game for me!

She said sorry for these other girls, let's get real motherfuckin' real motherfuckin' real
These other fake friends tried to trick me so Im gon' play em

Tell them these lies, you just need to learn how I made things right
Ain't no problem with this type of shit
I hope I had someone that cared for all people in school and knew that I was going through hell
Gave me the world, but Im in a position where I'm facing adversity
I dont like this shit, I want nothing but an apology from everyone who ever came out on me

But they know somethin' or what they lack you can keep your distance away from them and make an impact on life. I know we've got different attitudes but that has to come from both sides of the coin. We're both a little bit out here that are wrong as well." -I know they just want some control, let's not fight for what's right with the wrong people in this world while we all take the blame and blame. We have a voice which means our generation's gonna find their own common ground. Yeah yeah what we see may be in the end of us all because of us -they still play in the same game that we used to be and that's why...the people who died are never going back to their own lives with no respect for the ones who suffered so much pain or death for themselves and society because of us and this war is getting older every day because it's getting worse every day because it's getting worse every day because of us alone because of us each other because of us each other like we were meant to be, that's why life isn't just an issue only we chose to put our hands up instead of stand together as though it was nothing but a game we played and it wasn't nothing but a movie we played against each other and every time we try to turn around and cry, everyone on our world is saying something to me, tell my momma

What's your opinion on the current position of this nation?"

Verse 1:
Ain't nothing but a frowning face in your eyes
And a few words that you won’t understand just tell it as a dream
That is everything about you, that is something we have to move upon
For the moment when we all seem quite different things have been changing
But what if our leaders just aren't ready for war? I'll think so with a grain of salt and I'll try now to figure out their meaning to make sense
Maybe today would be the world because of the people who will stand up to the guns we will provide for those who suffer from being slaughtered and abused at gunpoint
With a bunch of fucking guns inside this country and my people, gonna say what does that mean? Is it really love or hate? If we keep pretending that our life has always happened too soon in hopes that some day we might live in tomorrow

Came after us as our children and as the stars begin to dim in our eyes
And as our future looked bleak and miserable we began to notice how much more beautiful we were as humans
What would ever change is just a day that will unfold as our lives begin to fade into oblivion
We will never be alone forever

Hook :
(Yeah, yeah)
Everything is beautiful
Nothing can replace itself
Everything is beautiful
No matter what you may choose to believe what you see
Everything is beautiful
I wish it would come out the way that it hurts to be sad by yourself
And instead of talking about your problems with friends like me, then I want to take a minute to read just how important your feelings are
Well, I hope you realize I know this and I want you to believe that you will understand me better and honestly
And that you will listen to me and that you will believe that most people are just like me. You are special to me since I am just a child
The only thing that matters is all we care to do right here and there. Everybody knows that I grew up a little bit out of touch with family, friends and friends (I really didn't)
So even though I used to worry about you, I wanted to let you know that I love you and don't fear you

Says- Yeah - So many times i asked you if it’s okay now, said- Hey, and you said- Okay well, and you gave me your best advice about the future...yeah, I went and got this thing together and i came together, and that was really it...
Now everybody wants a story about where our generation went before this. Some have to say, “You must stay away, what are you doing now?'” Well maybe this ain't true but i know your answer is what the American people want, right now, it's gonna happen tonight

He said this but what if when did I start from nothing? I could break free but now you've got no choice about yourself
If they say that I couldn't love you, there's no reason for pretending to cry
So tell him, put faith in me cause now he gets into trouble
But tell him I'll take it slow because then you and me will both get into trouble
But that's where life goes when nobody needs you, boy

You're not alone or strong
You are just as lonely as you have ever been, boy

Well you used to tell yourself everything would be alright after all
But now today we're goin' nowhere together
Like a million worlds below, man

He said this but what if when did I start from nothing? You'd see how hard I've been through, baby
So tell him, put faith in me cause now you got to believe in me, baby

Not even to listen to him when I thought of you at dinner time, but instead you said you wanted someone real nice guy, but the truth is, you are very fucking boring shit that isn't good for me. So let it all go, baby, why should we have to do this again? Why bother trying to bring back memories from when we left each other and the one who made it to the end of that shit? Is that the only way God can see me when I'm in love with you, your life was full of lies, and you're already dead

No one does nothing more than show us, nothing more than hold it true

And you know I told god that it would be alright if I asked you
To be all that you would be without me, I said
Your love, my lovе
Nothing more than just love, nothing more than love
You know I told you to be all that you would be without me
Just remember everything has changed up, I will never stay the same, just remember everything I've done before you leave this place!
It's better to get through our daydream together; there don't even need another one! Because it is perfect, and I did just my best since I was six years old, and now I have to share my heart with you

And though I've heard so many things and many people that I think I should know better
I wouldn't say I'd write this song unless you told me it was easy

Love makes me happy but it makes me sadder

That could find somebody you really wanna be with

In another place, where nobody gives me direction
So, tell me what do you feel about being gone ?
How far has my life changed?
So here with all things that I'm doing
Why did you always seem so sad?
Was it just good luck?
'Cause everything I am looking through means I can find some new meaning

Tell me, are you ready to go?
I'll keep on telling myself "Don't worry, no baby son, this is just a fact"
But if your heart keeps beating away
Please stay alive babe...


VERSE 2:
Ayo, I know this song won't die without ya
'Cause honestly it's not your fault
But all of us have our hearts full of hope
I guess that's okay
Just hold on to my promise to you
'Cause i know i might cry for you
And you've known my mistake
My heart hurts and your eyes will bleed to see you again

Yeah, this ain't your plan
And you know I'm wrong
(No)

Yea Lord, just pray for hope you hear us tell em (tellem)
Hope you read the Bible and the good word Jesus says, I was raised with my parents (God)
Mama told me
I was raised with my family and brothers, who didn't even speak English
She said, you gotta take care of yourself to make someone okay
Well, I can help her, but it's not my place (it's my house)
How I want myself to feel (and how I want myself to feel)
Now she say it's easier to hold your head high than jump into my car (ride)
Cause it takes every breath
Of life to break something, break something or die
Break a broken heart to tear apart
And I'm ready to feel this way
You won't have to let 'em run away (they won't have to keep running away from these hearts... Ohhhh.)

Verse 1:
And I just let go so damnation, it's time to let go - and all my people won't be the same
So how could you possibly get some kind of reason?
Them kids was like "Why not take me back home?" And in my head, that was wrong
The kid was like "'I want what we got, girl?"
You never know well enough before you try to make yourself famous?
Just because there is no one will erase its place in society
Is that why they tried to change the world for you?
Because they had to change their life for you cause they knew they wanted better than no one can. 
No more problems with a bad guy with nothing to give
So when the world stopped turning us on, and instead turned us upside down
They say they've changed the world since they went off the drugs and started seeing evil within
Why don't you ask them if they have anything left for you? Just because a demon exists inside your body that will put you first
And I do everything to stop that feeling, and tell you
Do something to stop these demons from wanting nothing at all
Cause all of their lies are fake stories, so then they'll let go of their past
Oh, and it's like that after all, I feel the same way before it even came around. What should I've known, and how could I be still standing here now?

Our dreams come alive, it's been so long since I've ever felt this way
We had some issues with everything we've made together
The story is over now
To show our hearts how we live together
But what's the meaning if you see nothing else
In life? What?
So far and we can't forget until tomorrow
Forgiving for our love isn't gonna pass us by because this dream will fade away.

For all my sins that I did, why do I still live in poverty?
Why can't we all pay our way back home?
Why can't our love be enough? Why can't we get by?
When my Father died before my parents could hear Him saying "Son, forgive me any sin"

Did anyone remember who they were and
Couldn't understand you, if not myself?
That you didn't hear of them you had another
And every once every memory we would be forever apart
Now nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry to say this can't be the best kind of thing

All of my love is fading away... (yeah), all you can do is see, just what it seems like
As I lay here alone and nothing remains for real anymore
Everywhere I look, I get lost
I find a place I can be found for myself to be. You are in my own world with me
Everything is so different now, things have changed
But I'm still loving you, and that's enough for me to admit... (oh yeah)

Verse 1:
This song makes love feel a little better
It keeps my senses low if only they had it together
The reason why I cry and cry each night is because of him
I can't help but think how things will go
To try to make life right, gotta keep on looking forward
Just being by yourself, yeah, just being myself just doesn't mean that you don't belong
Can’t help but let these tears drop even higher than falling down
So I gotta give whatever it takes to get myself through these difficult times
Treat myself like a drug while sleeping at the wrong time
So maybe you would learn from this story, don’t just keep going forward
If you had a drink then your mind would start to runnin' over something and thats nothin like you
And you will always be here tomorrow, gonna give everything you need

Started on a journey from a little girl down to somewhere in Florida"
Then she went to the island and found her home. Now she sees me and I’m looking here all the time, I wanna be here alone!
I wanna be here alone with myself. It could be the last day, you know I will be there! In a world where everyone has their dreams set free! In a world where everyone has your dreams set free! In a world where they have their dreams set free!
In a world where everyone is their one way way home! In a world where everyone can find their love, everywhere is everybody's dream…

It doesn't seem all right, everything won't work out if you want it, then it doesn’t work out if it doesn’t work out if you want it, then it doesn't work out if you want it that’s where we are
And I'm sorry, my thoughts always linger, this life will just keep moving forward as I strive for my dreams

The world is beautiful
You see me going for miles and miles
But it's getting better each day
My future is so bright
And when I see you at the beach (a sun)
I feel so bad
I’ll be floating in
Cuz I’ll need you here with me
The more I try to take it back (let's go)
The harder it gets
The harder it gets
No matter how hard it gets

Somebody's gone or gone away
But you still got the courage to do a better job

Just tell him something you want
To hear it
His voice says something you're trying to say in vain! He'll say
"But I still don't understand what's 'bout you?"
This is why I was born today
I don't know what makes you change about me but I know you're gonna hear it!

If he says something you say, he will say
"Oh yeah, but this love is only temporary
Because I was born today
Please don't let them hurt me
Cause this life never ends…
All the tears are gonna fall down
And there isn't no sunshine!
As long as I get here together, I'm not gonna have to worry too much sometimes

"No doubt you hear this line from the poet, who speaks this line at every moment." His verse is a classic in an age where no one comes near
He spoke his mind and he told a while ago for help.

When I first wrote your poem about the love that fell down to you my dear friend, I never seemed so certain that it would come true
I just had some patience just to learn how to relate to someone else like you
(Instrumental break)

Chorus: "The storm keeps fallin' 'cause thе sun keeps fallin', but the grind don't stop
The dawn falls in, as night goes by the morning light (as rain drops away)
And time moves onward on and so forth (the dawn falls in and on and so forth)
A young man's journey along, it is all good to know you're still here
There's nothing left for us to do but feel like we can survive out of our lives, no we won't go back

Verse 1:
Mama told me
"There's nothing you can do 'cause it's my child, and I've known you'd do better for your life"
But if there is a change in circumstance then that's what your voice says (that's who you're being)
Is there a future where love stays within the past?
And if the world were to change now this would be it?
I'm getting too used to being so blind
When we say things aren't right, people just pretend you're better off
People just pretend their goodbyes won't get hurt
And believe in what one must be thinking
Don't ask yourself how your whole life was goin' wrong until they really have some choice
So don't say anything out loud
Cause sometimes you can't take what's inside
And when the world falls apart, you start to doubt yourself, because
You don't wanna learn anything about all of those things that you could possibly care less

Chorus:
Losing focus

Verse 2:
Everybody want attention
Everyone wants a little attention
Everybody wants that attention
Everybody's always on the lookout

Just know your worth
If it's a lie everyone knows
Nobody knows why you lied

It's the truth that can save you from someone else's wrath
And let them decide your fate
That's what's keeping you awake
Because these are words that will always follow

Oh, ohhhh

You don't even need a reason
But please
Believe in what we do
But please
Tell us something different
You are somebody with real strength

I can tell you all your secrets
Well, this is you

You might just say it
But believe in what one should be feeling
When we are living life after death...
Everything we know we can do, so
Everyday, trying to find peace
In front of everybody at night

Everyone telling em lies
Everyone telling em lies

Because of what you have learned from the past is more than it gives you the strength to overcome the pain you have had. And when emotions can't be overcome, you have to cope with this pressure. It could never be this complicated...

It'll be fine you can take my love, but I'll try
I think about it sometimes I'm losing
And trying to make myself fit
Just so I can say bye!
We started off here just like two brothers
But that don't make me happy
As I get older you will leave
I know one day you might get the same, but please do remember
Life is a hustle yeah

All the times i was down before
They're all mine
Everything i dreamed of always meant something better
(repeat chorus)
My life seems brighter today
The people they'd miss when i woke up this morning
Can't explain why im looking
I don't know the reason what makes you happy
Even when i realize you're missing out on your chance
Now I hate everyone you got
You said that i don't care who's next next, no!

Verse 1: Gwen Stefani and Dwayne Johnson;

“I got my hands up” – I don't know if I'll ever get to her
If all they want is not being honest – but there's no stopping me now
Can't even wait to move on from that
You're so selfish now, I must feel it too
Grow up from the bottom of this
In the game we play
We can compete, go out and fight for love
For something so right
There won't be another party, no
Not gonna fight you, not gonna fight you (Not gonna fight you!)
Go outside while i look at your neckline
Don't get confused – I really wanna see your picture
I'm feeling like I don't know how to say anything
But if you don't have enough to please you
If you've always been in denial – why?
Why do people even think you know?

Bridge:

(I hate, I hate it and I hate you)

Oh…
(I wanna see who loves his body inside him because he can't have it alone! He cannot let go!)

No one thinks it's fair, oh man – you're so selfish now
I just wanna see who loves his back now (he cannot have it alone!)

Creating worlds so strong are they weak?
God is stronger than the gods that we know of
Wash-mapped souls in the sun
Selling out that dreams can never be complete
Catch a glimpse of reality
And it’s like the night before
We’ve lost sight of who we all are

In my heart I don't need to feel so sad
In my face your heart is broken
Your only way to get there is through my suffering
It was meant for this moment but now we're all alone
The world we built for us is filled with sin
But God has shown us where to start

Conquering the demons of a lifetime. Through time I reach up above every wall around me
I've become a man from outer space. In my mind beyond everything that surrounds me
And all this is for sure - to show everyone there is something beautiful
For the moment that nobody will see. And when I find a way to reach out and make my way I'll be there
To show everyone there will be light in my eyes
If you need help with who I am today...
I'll be here to call to your friends where everything is fine! I'm standing ready
At the beginning of my journey I'll begin to understand the reason why God is here....

But we are still fighting, battling battles that never ends
You just want more from us!  You're making it clear to him! He knows what goes through your heart and is stronger than an angel or a king

Verse 1:
You should call your friend and ask him where he got the hook and how they got it figured out
You know the answer would be as long as she was on the phone asking if he would come over tonight
And we had a little conversation about that moment
To start a conversation or two about that time when the sun came up too low for me to say anything
And then you went out into a dark room with her friends and our exes looking at each other and whispering their thoughts 'round and around'
This one thing's clear is that the whole time when we talked our whole lives were laughing and laughing and talking and laughing
We all have regrets about our past
But I really think it's only because you do the same everyday
It's only because you just love me, you don't treat this woman like that girl like that
Anyway you're such a sad mess I'm so happy my story can start again in a different colour
Or not the way you used to treat this girl. We were never gonna believe in that man we're talking about

Verse1:
A lot of people have tried to escape
They used to be afraid just for a long time
But now I realize when things change they'll always be there once again
It's always good to see your face so right now you're on your own
People in the streets are telling you that they've never met you before
But it's hard to get along without having someone say nothing
To find someone who is the human being you want to be
And maybe your best friends and all will get to know you for sure when they all fall apart
You were trying to forget about yourself you never should fear yourself

Told me sometimes too easily that you don't really want to be someone else
Cause with all this feeling, we got this feeling
When somebody tells you that they need you more then everyone else could ever mean anything and everything
You feel like you finally love someone else but everyone hates you
I think that there's something in being here for everybody that needs someone

Chorus:
I've been here before - forever inside you (you)
Always stay where you want to be (you)
I've been here before - everyday inside you (you)
Living with someone new and someone new (something you)
Everywhere I go I miss one day after the first try
I'm always tryin' and tryin' not to cry because you're hurtful
Because the world goes on, it always goes on
I'm on my way from the start
There is no need to hide in my past or remember
I can hear myself saying, "oh baby, what happened last night?"
All around town, I go away
Everybody gets lost inside their memories while nobody goes home
Everyone is told in their songs in their prayers for peace and happiness
Everyone is told in their songs and on every single night they sing

Verse2:
Sometimes you run and run with someone
And you can say you still want to live here
But as soon as someone tries to tell you you that you should leave, you're all alone
Nobody knows exactly what they're gonna do if they take what it takes to put you through this pain, yeah
Someone has decided to come around who will be there to take care how I feel
No one knows exactly what they're gonna do if they take what it takes to put you through this pain

Now look what you put in front of me here was made for you
I'm gonna go out in the night and take my heart again
Because this time is so special I thought everything was a dream
But when I find out that you've been trying to save me now
All of my sins are erased

And now, in despair, I can't believe that I'll never end it
I'm not sure, that I'll ever understand
What does it mean to be honest?
Myself is like a shadow of a wall
Of myself surrounded by others who seem real
Forget my pride about their own lies
No matter how hard I try
My words won't fade away

I had to take a risk and I did not take it. But I stood tall...
So many times I've held my head before I came upon this ledge of water. I've tried to run it but everything has turned to stone. Now I must fall and burn! Life's the hardest part...

So many times I've lived through this dream that is true. That was how I found the ground and I dug myself into it all. I was alive when you took me away...I was scared that, all I could hold by yourself are tears

Rotation by the rhythm of rhythm. The wave comes crashing up into a rock in a rhythm, right-hand side of a rock and the back.
You can hit any type of place with the top, and we can throw that rock right away.

Verse 1:
And even though she used to be so nice, who could not? In the middle of my head, she was just saying love and love songs on her brain.
She said, girl, I'm like, do you remember if you were really ready (Do you remember whether you really have it?)
Then she said, why don't you pick up your phone and call me again? (Are you not sorry)
Oh, how the fuck does it get out of hand?
When you try to get off this, well what happens when the truth is always getting out of hand?
It's always getting out of hand and the only thing keeping me from telling lies is getting out of hand?

Fires are burning so don’t try to get it twisted like a candlelight
I see the sky over me so far out of place without anyone to save me
The ship's heading toward us now and then is left here at sea. And what happens next, isn't even happening anymore
If we're both living in the past with one more chance to find something new you better hold this moment tight

And if tomorrow has been our best bet now as they say, why would we care anyway anyway?
Even when things are getting awkward now, they can still make the night seem nice again

And a ship is sinking
Like this, it flies to Cape Cod
The world was made for water and sea, so we made the boat

So now we're slaves in all of Africa
That they have become more like slaves
But they won't give up anyway, just as slaves were forced to fight, right?

Verse 1:
I’m here for you. If you need something go hard and take me over
Just give me one second. If all of this time it’s me that is gonna be right (yeah)
Cause when you come home and get out your chair it’s gon’ be a blast
I remember you in the crowd with a big gun and she came down on us
We were scared so we kicked it out and put it down
And then the other night we left out the door because, uh
We pulled up just to show love to everybody
So we threw our lights on because he didn’t have nobody in the room
Hearing how many shots went off every fucking night
When I look in the mirror I can see my friends crying
And they really wanna know why but just gotta tell me who the fuck did they want more?

So don’t be alarmed cause your body started to decay
Now let me run up against the wall so you just know what it takes to pull yourself out of your world
And if you got no idea why there’s nothing you’d do to save your life now
So just stand there like I’m running out of time for you to get out of your world
And baby I hope I say it but I wanna start and make myself proud about you
But don’t just sit here pretend it isn't okay girl, I should open up my eyes
My heart is racing faster than the speed we was at before the first song we heard
We had to move on because everything changed, man
You looked down on me I saw you smiling but then you said “No!”
Said “Whoa, you’ve lost your mind?” and then you felt great but I had nowhere to hide and I was too scared of you
My brother told me my brothers had gone to college because of you!

Chorus:
They call me king, but never called me brother
The game's going on
I'm starting to see them falling...
I'm getting more money as I turn 65
But all that drama around me shows me it doesn’t matter which way you choose to go
Somehow they would just laugh and yell to my momma I thought she would stop acting sad
They call me king and he tells me his daddy killed us and that son is so nice
He tells me now my family was dying and his dad told me he was tired of crying
And I realized that even though it hurtin' but they knew that it would never end so I stood and cried
But when I look back I see this pain in my eye and wonder why my brother died so many times
Sometimes I just cry and think about how I used to die but this anger is not the reason I should always live another day
Because I can feel this hate inside of my brain

Verse 2:
Just like everybody else, it’ll only help me grow
To understand and comprehend who I am before that shit happens
Just follow me and try to figure out cause I shouldn’t be holding onto anything but myself yeah
Just because our parents died makes it alright for me to leave your world
Cause there are people in my life that couldn’t help me but get out of my world
Forgive me for what  I've done, I had my soul shattered and maybe damaged
Because I don't care where I step from but still remember that you made me stronger
So I pray I will get to know you

(Chorus)


[Verse 1]

Please forgive me when I say I didn't deserve anything. Asking yourself please go away. My brother will treat as if they aren’t as important. He knows I understand him best because his heart goes out, he just wants another fight or someone better than me. However, on some other day, I will just want to be happy enough to end this pain until it hits something worse for us to achieve. We will find a way through these problems when together we need you to take my strength. So let’s try as hard as possible to keep this world together. This life is full of people who fight. If you believe in God, then put all of them into action right here. And we will lead them to realize real progress. Let’s see how good it has been for everyone before. The story that I told was nothing more than a dream. That vision was broken through tears by the end of the day. Everything about you, you have shown me everything you could ever be. Nowadays you know where to go if you are prepared, I got one call to you every night. You’re ready for disaster, and sometimes I feel so low as ever. You can never bring around me no matter what you do in order to get help. When it’s your time to make decisions, it will be alright until the fight ends. I got time for change, but you’ve found a place to heal and now you are back on your feet. We have to be able to face this world our brothers and sisters face everyday. We have some goals to reach. Take a part in this movement, and we will build and grow. Don’t forget, baby this is the start of this thing again

[Verse 2]

Keep up with me, I need you to stay strong, and be wise. Be willing and listen to all that I say. And I am listening on behalf of anyone who has felt it for just a while. To be as much a part of you is always worth it. Never question the worth of what your heart gives you - because you’re making progress. You won’t have to prove anything in life. You don’t have to know that you're the only one in the world that can do that. You will always be a real man, you will always be a figure.

[Chorus]


[Verse 3]

Please forgive me when I do this. You have given me hope for a brighter future. I will keep believing in you that you are not afraid of being an option. I think that it’s something very special that I need to remember you’s true faith in yourself. So it must be a sign that we will survive together! No matter who you’re trying to be with and you will always be there to bring us together again. This life should be free of competition, and this life is a victory for everyone. If everybody stays together the first one gets stronger. Don’t give up on yourself.
We really need to make some choice! Just make a choice between letting go and fighting on our own terms. This is why we always stand ready. Our hearts can open wide for this world of change. If we make it too tough, we might burn it with fear and let it fall apart once and for all. And until it finds our way our path to freedom, we will all be there for you! Go ahead and live

Verse 1:
Just as it started I’d look over again but this time now it is different
And here on earth I am the one i’m looking for
Cause there are no plans now but they will be through so quickly
I would rather have a car than have to travel alone, or try hard to find my love cause we both know exactly what we did
But it ain't fair ‘til I feel my fears, because I had enough of our friends back in the day
You made me believe that these times were the right ones ‘cause together we could get stronger just being human
The only thing holding onto my confidence is the desire to never let go of it
That keeps me alive I know something is wrong

Everything I said wasn’t the best it was always false
There was more to life than seeing faces around you
Like maybe you really knew it was better for every part of us
Even the most ignorant people keep telling lies ‘cause when we get along yeah sometimes times it makes sense

You get lost inside.. you become afraid. You get scared and scared. Everytime you close your eyes i see you there is no more
You cry.... your friends you cry. But in your dreams i always pretend
'cause these demons tryna feed off your pain , even though i would rather waste you

But those aren’t good news, and some don’t listen when they're gettin' played again
These rhymes are just songs for the new king
They’re also poetry meant for the young
The old king is a lyricist
He’s always on that beat when he’s writing a song
It's an odd, unique feeling when he's been in the spotlight
With your baby all alone
So go ahead, let’s see how we can move along.

[Verse 1]
I found another life and some kind of paradise
When you had a job with someone new that's mine
Then it went all the way to your house
Now you feel better everyday
Cause you really are me
But never have I been so damn fine
So don't give up on yourself for them too much
So you can just let them live their lives that they like themselves
You're the only one who wants their dreams in order to be what they want to see
You should just let them live their life that's gonna make an out today
And then come back around to your life without you

My heart would stop beating faster if everybody else knew that
I'd come down too high for you to reach up and try all that's possible

Change the way my mind feels inside of me - what is it worth?

I won't be living forever anymore

To see me go on this journey, we can do it right now
So hold me down and let me breathe this way:
I got no choice but to find a way, I am one step ahead!

Riot
It will never end if we stand by your side
If I have ever felt like anything
Innocence cannot be denied, of course. This life goes on and on and on over its head. People fall, people turn out differently than others in life, for well, sometimes, I swear sometimes. We were born to be strong
I guess when people talk about us, they always know that we're gonna change, or that we were never meant to be
And don't get caught up in the story, cause if they think we're crazy but then we really know we are. We could feel the same thing, the colors on our skin, those emotions in our souls everywhere. And don't get caught up in the story, because if they think we're crazy but then we really know we are..

And let me bring you along, please help me understand why I've waited so long! I was just looking at myself
You gave my heart, and it helped me realise that it couldn't be real
I just started writing something called, a fantasy universe, and it has made a world around my love and mine! (Yeah okay!) You're part of it, I believe. I believe. In reality, I believe
That this world of ours is for you. Let me come inside (Let's break it down)... let me show you how much it means - baby let's jump out!

And slowly, the forest is blackening and silent
With you all my love, I know each other better

Love and you belong by free

I’m searching for hope when dreams slip away through time
My time is running out I can't stand it in sight
Cause when you're waiting for your light to return

So I ask myself am this feeling? I never seem to know
What do they mean if it's always just another thing?

Maybe because they had gone away, at least they tried to change my life
And what I found in that is so good now
I don't think I've given up on myself

If everything that you've got to give is up for grabs
And if you're not, why won't somebody come through with me?

Chorus:
My story's told just like it should be
I'm not a slave to the day that this world comes around
And my stories say it gets closer and closer, so it may be true
What makes me go astray is clear

You make me fly

Verse 1:
Gotta work but feel it
Got to take care of your own
Keep an eye on you when you need something new (what are you waiting for?)
I know everything about your body(it is) it looks perfect and feels like its real
Don’t get nervous bout your style or not you get tired of this (oh oh, woah)
You want me in the same way that you always do
No matter what you ask them they say you won't be no other
So many ways of loving myself I'm telling you to go ahead just one more song
I hope you understand why you gotta start thinking about yourself you should let off their guard
Do some things or not because you're too busy working everyday to lose time for my dream

Verse 2:
They said love can keep you satisfied but you ain't got enough
So it's not getting any sweeter though if you really try hard now
I hear these voices screaming out loud
Please do not make a fuss cause you gonna be gone soon
But you can't stop it cause you only have one life so the only time you can fight is when you finally wake up for yourself

Pre Chorus:
I mean to say it's crazy, what I’m asking now is here being honest
That’s all I think of today...
[?]
And how to find peace, so we could come together better than before
How good would you be if someone told us you didn't love us? I guess we did...
What would you do if someone told us that you were lying down with another man
Or the way you act when someone tells you’re lying down with another man (oh oh)
Well tell me am I going broke just to see this through
Am i acting right if a woman is lying down with another man
How can I be serious if I tried to tell you she was lying down with her boy? Yeah
So tell me am I going broke just to see this through
Am I going broke just to see this through
Am i acting right if a woman is lying down with another man

Verse:
Wondering of how long it could last
When life was so much fun
They started talking me stupid shit
I remember they said they were better off with you
Now there’s no point fighting them back now
It won’t be long until I die again just know i still feel empty
Don’t care if it hurts or not
Gotta stay alive, gotta get out of here before it gets too late to breathe
Dancing in the rain, going through the desert
Loving every moment that I had is enough of it
But all I want to do is make my choice, right!
I should've stayed up watching the sunrise
Just knowing that this was just another chance to wake up from my dream

It ain’t easy when this love starts, it could come too late

All I really need are drugs, and I’m hoping that you help me find out later on (Repeat )

All my slaves were sold and murdered, in their desperate bid for glory.
They fought in blood, but the masters were the thieves and the priests and priests
Our enemies were the peasants and in order to fight our war! Why does he bring this here?
Why do I keep believing in God and Satan instead of being here?

Told me, what is the difference between a heart attack and an early morning walk
I said, let go my heartache, how to begin
If you had something like us, would things never be that I could not do?

Hook :
I don't know what went wrong but if you’re right (Let go) You'll find it hard to believe we are just the same, so let's face it.. You're gonna make it rain, but when it rains, then we're gonna break you down. And I think back…When we broke and were meant for war, people would always say the words we never said

Hook:

They said that even though you had a plan
That you wouldn't make it through today… you're still alive
Everybody thinks they're safe but there are times when your family dies too late
Everyone thought they'd be able, but you were leaving them behind

And now all time we've changed our ways since you left
And the world has changed and everyone feels the same way… We live through our mistakes because we made them last
So why won't you? Well we'll have to learn from ourselves! No one wants love

If you were a girl and you weren't sure what to do
You wouldn't wanna be somebody else

But you take the risk so your kids don’t cry
But you are good at keeping things simple

The way you treat your life is very cruel when you’re doing wrong
But you take the risk so your kids don't cry
And they don’t love another one

Verse 1:

And it’s what they’ve said before. They’ve said it through an open door
But now is a day when all of them all say the same but now are holding on to one another till we lose our grip and we fall asleep in pain and despair
What’s going on around here? We need to know just how this ends, I don’t know whether we could be the ones who had so much fun
I guess I won’t make it out again until somebody says it’s true 'cause there is something that isn’t real
So I don’t wanna go to church because I just think about everything that was
We were trying things for others but they were hurting us everyday
I’m not trying to tell everyone that it’s okay that I can believe that if you really loved someone like me
To be honest with myself, I got so many struggles I couldn’t be sure of who to trust or care about
How long is it supposed to be worth, and can your heart stop beating back and forth, I wish I could do better, but then it wasn’t possible to
Make you smile, you cry, you cry
If you really did love someone you didn’t feel like at all
It’s more than the end, and it’s nothing new at all
I’ve met a lot of people who were afraid to put their lives behind a wall
But sometimes I wonder if it feels great when you’ve lived through life instead
I hope it’s finally done, we’ll never ever see no difference
I’ll find myself somewhere in the future, somewhere in our past
Like any dream, it could end up happening anyway
No matter which way this goes
All over everybody's lives have been going on for years now
This world is growing bigger every day, we are seeing
This world is growing older every day
Even the hardest times are getting boring, that’s why most people take things to the best of me
The hardest nights always seem to last forever, sometimes I’d rather be alone when I want to leave
Life just seems so long and dark and the sky turns gray and I’ve tried to move away from this, but i’ve been thinking for years now, this place has become a little tighter than this

Catch me on the highway running round town (walking down roads) 

Verse 1:
No I don’t know why I see it, so how far have we came
We all are living in a strange place 
There are animals but my lungs are just big clouds
I’ve got no clue what I must have feared
But maybe some things changed and this time our dreams come true to my heart
When is it time for me to wake up
And when the sunlight goes down? What have you become!

The moment we break free from these memories
I can see that everything will eventually be alright and we'll be good again today
Life will change and the night will end tonight
What's this feeling of peace? What does it mean??

Guitar parts used to play inside of me
They used to say we could be great! But now they turn out right
They tried to do us wrong because we all love one another
Now we live through this war in all of my senses
Some people forget about us and they think they're fine
Sometimes I wish that you'd look the other way...
It’s just sad, It feels different
All that i see is a smile stuck around my face
You smile at me once

Verse 2:
Oh, so many things you said
Can't you see exactly what it was ? And you try not to get right away
Nowhere in the world could i stand just because you didn't want to run away....

I couldn’t care less, I couldn’t see the signs, I couldn’t see the signs

Just know what you feel in your heart will be true
So keep on going forward
You got me looking back
I hope that you’ll remember
But just let it be known
That something happened
And as always, you and I made mistakes
Still they still remain the same
So please take care of yourself
There is no one else but you

Hook:
So you don’t go around that way, unless it gets too hard
Tell me how the world keeps going wrong for you and my family
If everyone thinks I got a flaw in why?
There’s no way I can fix it when I look into your eyes
It’s been more than this for years and years and years of pain
Don’t give any crap, just make a stand, don’t let anyone ever try cause there’s nothing left but regret
Please tell me where would you be if a time was right?
When people say that they think life’s easier than it could possibly be
I’ll only just keep on living out my dreams and hoping those times end
I know it's not easy saying anything, trying to get back where you were
Don’t think this can be the way that I know that I ought to be
Don't ask anybody if I’m scared of tomorrow...

Chorus:

To go out and do a good job

[Verse 1]
If we were together
Would be the first time when all my fears were gone
Do you mean me to be there tonight?
Will tell me what is real, really real ?
Is this the best thing I’ve ever known?
It sounds like a dream but it’s not too late now for the day, oh
[Chorus]
If I could be somebody who would have thought that I'd give up my heart
I'd never think I've ever seen someone so beautiful that I could really see
'Cause everything I did is worth living for
And every single day that I live just keeps fading away
'Cause every single day that I grow into someone I will never forget

Reality is what you say but we'll break it down for you if you don't know what to do
If I want to break from this life I've been through before, I swear, I can’t stop pretending
That people are scared of me when they see my face

I really wish I knew

Is this how we should keep living, when people cry because you try to break us apart?

This will still be right

Like a hurricane through which nothing was possible
But all that I wanted could make it happen
All that I wanted could make sense of you were mine every so often
I couldn't see any brighter than the night before me
I wanna be here just for the good of me
I need this world gone with me instead
You and I are not going anywhere
What will do if love becomes empty?
If only there were no roads or bridges
So we could build out in each other right back home
My hope is no one could ever say goodbye
I guess it’s time to step away
Forget everything that I feel about you today...

Because I knew before I started growing
I learned from lessons that

Things were just like this
Everything grew slowly and never stopped for me
But now I know I made it worth it
Never had to play games anymore
And every night I wish I could lose control for my health
Cause nothing changed after everything I have done
Every bit of happiness that had happened since they came
Is amazing how many people turned things around instead of turning their backs
Now reality does change when you try to make a statement that feels like a lie
Don't let these excuses take away your dreams that you cannot believe in
But even if it takes some time
Even for me though I tried
Don't let them fake stories
Even if it takes time
Even if I tried cause I tried cause I tried
You're the thing for everybody... and we could still be

No one knows what it's really like
And now that it is, we gotta make it work but not

Nowhere to go, nowhere else to run
No money to buy but a phone and a car
A ticket for a weekend, it’s driving us crazy!

I’m moving in circles on top of the mountains
That have gone all summer with the trees blowing down
With each day coming in there again to see this world before those lights still shine
And then things don’t change though, because these streets know what to do. And the stars don't shine bright as snow falling over
Cause I know life's hard for any man when you move too fast and get stuck in trouble
But I know it is tough being around when people say they can’t do much for you today
Because even if you come on home, you are forever stuck here at night
You ain’t no better than I, I pray to god that you feel alright

These streets whisper secrets I’ve yet to learn
Problems:
My own thoughts are unclouded
I don’t have the motivation to remain
I don’t have the ambition to move
In my mind it’s hard for me to feel at peace
It’s not always meant to be
You look good in these dark corners and you make a better world
And you can call the whole world home

Saying we should go away if i’m not able to see what happens next

Goddamn
Just let us breathe

My heart beats, and there’s no escape
My vision lights up but now is gone
My life changed, so don’t try wasting your time
Why you say that?

Verse 1:
What’s it worth about being brave enough and you know that you can fight or die
Cause you're always on the run when it’s safe to go
I just wish all of us would be happy to be free

These streets whisper secrets I’ve yet to learn
No one knows at all how deep they get

You won’t find me a soldier for so long

Gave you time in my arms and you got away this past year
I hope that the stars will change your mind forever
There won’t be no turning back, nothing is perfect today
Don’t know why or tell me I have to fight for justice in return

We are not our enemies anymore
Can we just save these scars once more?
Will we become this new world?

It might seem crazy now to think it’s just us
But I’m still young but I’m learning
That I can make a change here at home
Gave you time in my arms and you got away this past year
I hope that the stars will change your mind forever
There won’t be no turning back, nothing is perfect today
Don’t know why or tell me I have to fight for justice in return

We are not our enemies anymore
Can we just save these scars once more?
Will we become this new world?

Oh, please just let me hold you close

But at least I know it's gone
The moment I'm inside I know its over now, cause I know the answer

Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I want love to be real, but don't let my mind fool you
This is all I need (Yes)
To come alive again;

Like a pencil, with nothing but fear alone (Without the pain)

Verse 1:
How many times have I looked at these signs? And it didn't really matter at all, for a second
In a couple of short conversations you're living for a minute? It doesn't seem to matter at all
The answer lies in your eyes and a text messages
What I'm having is probably not the best
The only word I know is fucking you
You know it ain't fucking you, yeah!
I don't think there's any fucking way
If I could try your luck maybe we would both go through different stages
Either way, I don't want to be alone

Let's pretend everything is right or wrong
Just keep going while we go far down

R&B:
But you still hold your words and try not to stray from the lines that you want us to be
You feel the way I wanna move in life
Now let's get up to our roots now
Let's set those goals low, so you can start a revolution soon
Let's start the revolution as soon as possible
Don't say what you don't really mean
'cause baby, all the people around me see you
All your problems, how could you make my world work out without a fight?!
Yeah, baby, you said that you would change someone '
But you never do that but I'm glad you didn't even try it!

So far I dont know who i am, but still I feel free
My heart breaks on every song I choose
And it hurts when the music keeps breaking
And every time they fade away

Oh no, I'll listen to you
Because I've had enough, now we have time to show them
Love is getting weaker than before
But this feels right, baby
Just go through with your tears that I made for you
Love is giving me life so strong, because these tears are gonna break your heart
Cause a new light will shine while your smile disappears
Now let me tell you just how it feels, I'm ready to give it all up
'Cause you're giving me life like this
Yeah
I'm going to give it more and longer
You know

Hope we can do that together

Gonna call you anytime
Gonna call you at any time

The hardest days come true
They'll never come until they end soon

Why don't ya take away your innocence for me to have more control of me than I do?
And no one understands how this part ends when you got so caught up in it that you can't go back to find relief through the pain they brought

There's not much I can take from being without you right now
You're the only one I've ever known, even though there's so much I still need somebody else to hold on to
