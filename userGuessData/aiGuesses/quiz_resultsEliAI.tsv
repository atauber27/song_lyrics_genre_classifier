"From the hills to the valleys, I’m making my way
Producer(s): 2 Chainz, T-Pain
Hook:
Girl, this is life
You can tell by the way you take it
When your lips make me scream
Let it grow like a flower seed
We both know we're beautiful
And no one else can do what we do
As if we were ever given the chance to choose
To be as pretty and smart as we are

Verse 1:
I'm getting ready for a night out
It's not too late for the party
So just come around the place
Girl, don't worry about the bills or the drinks
I got enough to eat right now to last forever
And now that everyone's together
I really don't know where to look but love's in me
I get so jealous when I'm with someone new
That they think I got a little bigger hands than me
But all of our hearts are made up of atoms
I'd give anything just to love you back more

Chorus:
I'm from another planet
I came here today to tell ya
Yeah, girl I want to share the show tonight
Baby let me feel her heartbeat
Oh-oh-oh
I'm real close to the edge
She says she'll be fine
I put everything that we could have on the line (on the line)
No matter who the next man is before us

Pre Hook:
Girl, this is life
You can tell by the way you take it
When your lips make me scream
Let it grow like a flower seed
We both know we're beautiful
But no one else can do what we do
As if we had any clue that we were ever meant to be

Post Hook:
Everything about you seems alright"	rb	rap
"Every moment's a treasure, don't let it fade
Hundred-years of making you listen is all we've got

Pre chorus:
For our time will be spent in an endless stream of tears
But every hour brings promise and love forever

Chorus:
I'll never ever stop wishing on one another (oh no)
You're so beautiful I feel that I need your touch
Baby please just take me back to where we started
Tell me if this is what I want from you right now
Hold me for love and just give in
No matter how deep in our feelings there's still such a rush
That sometimes it feels like we end up going back to the start
And my heart doesn't wanna leave without you when i have nothing left inside me
We won't make it, 'til we're here again, never come out

Verse 1:
Just a man trapped inside a world
That tells us we'll eventually go down bad or high
But our dreams won't change but we don't understand ourselves with age

Chorus x 2

Bridge:
I hope that someday you'll see
That something like this can last forever
So tell me what can we do about this? It's hard to find, yeah
My precious soul just sits at Your feet

Pre chorus:
For our time will be spent on an endless stream of tears
But every hour brings promise and love forever...


Chorus x2"	rb	country
"What they talkin' 'bout? They ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'

Verse 1:
I ain't tryna make it big
Just a couple of kids, living my dreams
It don't come without worry

(Hook) X2
Don't worry bout how you feel
Be the man with your life, or be a piece for your family
If you live in need of something real real real easy
Get out the way to find yourself
Keep movin' on and gettin' back what we got
(Repeat Hook 2X)

Bridge:
So much about you, like the things I see in you
Tell me where you at cause there's always something better to do
Then keep going but let these tears fall down again

Verse 2:
Now here I stand in amazement
All this power that makes us all
There's just too many people in this world now
Not everyone has to earn it all then have it
See, people don't have to be paid
Instead, they look from every city, place, and everything
To tell them what to do so they can succeed
They think it's cool 'til they're rich, so they give up on it
In fact, when you've been there for far too long
You know one day you'll realize you gotta get away from this game
Your life gotta win"	rock	rap
"The waves crash down, but I still stand tall
(Drain the waves; you're gonna hear it every time)
Pre-Chorus:
Lyrical energy, lyrical power
I'm like water and your mind's a tidal wave
Climbin' in, you're on a rocker vibe
Lyrical energy, lyrical power
I'm like water and your mind's a tidal wave
Like Water and Your Mind's A tidal wave
Lyrical energy, lyrical power
I'm like water and your mind's a tidal wave
Synthically active through each of my songs

Hook:
Can't do it with these beats
It don't really matter how we keep going (keep going)

Verse 1:
Lyrical energy, lyrical power
I don't think that nobody could match just the way I feel when I'm writing this
But now listen to this beat, just for a second
Sink me deeper into what is real within an ocean
We are the force in this music, together we are strong
Letting go ain't easy, and if you know how difficult it is then maybe then you can stop it
And help it flow, and let it show, even though there's still a ton of lies in it
Allowing us release from all of the things that have kept you waiting
If this is how you were going to end up, or was it just part of the plan?

Pre-Chorus:

Harmony rhythm, harmonic energy
You should not take a ride with them, they'll take over your life

Hook:

Can't do it with these beats
It don't really matter how we keep going
Vulnerable to damage, so stay outta line
You gotta be patient, be ready 'til they turn the tide

Guitar Solo:

Bridge:
Vulnerable to damage, so stay outta line

"Under the neon lights, the future is ours
Producer(s): Jonny Lee Miller

Verse 1:-
Everytime you go to visit someone new
You need some direction from their heart
So come and take care
Of everything 'cause it could help you grow
When you look into your reflection there's a shining light
That’s why I see this world in your eyes for everyday dreamers
There was always somewhere we used to go

Pre-Chorus: (2x)
The moment that you were born
We shared our life as one
A chance to be in each other's company
(To be together without no one else but you)
Let's just forget what we've been through...
Verse 2:-
Before they had ever seen us cry
The world couldn't wait
And you wouldn’t even think twice
But now you’re just in time enough to know
Everything 'round is meant to lead you where you are heading
Take control of all your plans then open up the door
Cause all your dreams will fall into perfect shape and form
Now with confidence here on Earth
It feels like home
In the eyes of the night
In the eyes of the night
I'm just saying baby give me the chance I need right now!

Pre-Chorus

Chorus x4"	country	pop
"I see the stars align, guiding my way home
From our galaxy view to infinity, I'm soaring above you
‘cause everybody's right there

When you turn your back on this earth, I will never stop loving you (no)
You're my heart, hold it inside for just one day (yes), you give me joy and life
I am with you - only time you'll understand why
And not another time that we are apart of a starry night
There's nothing else I can do
Please, let me show you how to fly so far away!
Come closer when we're falling out tonight
The colors still shine brightly... but they'll burn dimly
'Cause, oh no they won't
So come closer when we're falling out tonight
Love is something that will never die, and i feel that love is here again
Here in my heart forever more, forever more, love forevermore…

Hook:
Feel myself rising up high, like I could find someone new
'Cause now i got someone who's always there
No hesitation no question
I believe in this world
Wake up when the skies look bright, as if I was dreaming
Dreaming and feeling all over the place
'Cause all these nights have been going slow and steady
But now what i've gained is more than the amount
That he made me get
From every corner of the globe, from space to pain, all i ever wanted to be...

Verse 1:
Your love has led you back into my arms by my side
What a sweet love it is, you are a precious gem to me
My whole world knows that when you turn your back, you need someone, I'm ready
You are such a perfect thing that helps to ease my broken mind
The memories will haunt ya dreams while you sleep at night
And remember everything that was you and I had before
We were born to soar together, but we couldn't live without You... But I know... I don't want to break free yet
It's your love that made us fall this way, baby..."	pop	rb
"Walking down roads I’ve never seen before
No need to go all night

Verse 1:
I've been living life without your touch, so why am i getting low? 
I swear there's no reason for me to be so numb when I don't even feel the same. So many obstacles that you placed on my path but I was only in the beginning, now im just stuck in between them and feeling lonely because of those obstacles that you always had for me (I lost it from the start) and thats bad

Chorus: x2 “what was I told you last time I talked to you???   It’s hard enough to believe this shit still holds onto you like you’ve got nothing left or you’re not ready anymore.  Just let the drama happen.  Let them see exactly what they want to hear
No matter how bad it gets, this heart hurts more when it’s broken than when you cry.  But if it stops, please just accept it, Im sorry!  I tried! I lied!!!  This life just doesn’t come easy.   And all the other days I felt lost, scared & ashamed, but I wanted someone who would make me whole.  When I thought you’d take my side, I had to leave you alone.  Now I'm just going through the motions, like walking right back into my hole, cause nobody’s ever heard a sound till now!  But wait!!  But at least then im alive, because I can breathe....."	rap	rb
"The waves crash down, but I still stand tall
(Oh-oh!)
Hook:
I'm a boy that's trying for all these things
You're gonna need only one who wanna follow your heart
For me, yeah it'll always be the same
I got to let you lead me out of my mind (Wooooow)

Baby I want everything
When I take time, girl just know it will be worth it
It is in me. I am not just a puppet
Just listen while I speak and keep on working til we are alright
(So please just promise yourself baby, this isn't over yet.)
Don't go crazy when I hold your hand
Let me see how long you would leave your mark
Love is good, if you make love with someone special (Yes)

Bridge:
And don't you fall apart, baby let it come through like this every night
I could've done it any way, you would never have had this chance
I might be wrong
But my faith can help you through it too - oh...

Chorus:
You should stop messing with me babe, you know just how tough I feel inside
'Cause I'm here for ya until I die and there ain't nothing so perfect I can do without it
Yeah you can start by letting me take you on a different ride
My love is real enough
Make sure you stay up on the beat 'cause now she knows what love means
Chorus:
You should stop messing with me babe, you know just how tough I feel inside
'Cause I'm here for ya until I die and there ain't nothing so perfect I can do without it

"I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life
It’s me, I know you and I

VERSE 1 :  It’s just me and her
The whole crowd will never know what to say or do
Maybe now that our bodies are older (she is older)
Don’t make the same mistake again and again (this time it ends)
Can we both learn from it? Don’t forget it (maybe)
When we meet at our old place with a love so damn strong (in heaven we are)
We can be good together
That’s why this is why I let u come in
So let me give you a kiss on the lips (let me give you a kiss on your lips)
Lose control of yourself because you’ve got something
You really wanna feel something (yeah)
There’s a reason why not too soon
I keep my mind on everything (my brain)
VERSE 2 :  In some situations we don't mean it
Your words ain’t perfect but you tell yourself ‘bout it
It’s different everyday here
Some days you seem to have no intention anymore
But girl we’ll still meet up in the future
In other days might even go out and find something new
Saying the most is all we want right now
I hope that she gets to know him first before we leave here
I see we get closer, but we’re not meant to touch
We’rе more than friends, like we belong to somebody else
We were meant to each other
Then one by one, there was nothing better
It’s alright if he don’t help you down
Gon be alright as well
If he keeps taking away your heart from you
All his selfish stuff will fade
And nobody knows when it ends or how deep
Or the feeling inside of their hearts
That they couldn’t help with when it hits home
Just watch us grow. Just look into their eyes, yeah...

CHORUS x2
Ooh! He was so strong! He was so strong
He was so strong
He was so strong
They saw this little lady with gold hair
Watching us grow! Like a star
Because he is beautiful!

VERSE 3 :  They saw this little lady with gold hair
Watching us grow! Like a star
Because he is beautiful

No matter what the weather we will always have someone
Who'll always follow, like we should
You and I, we won't forget, ever more..."	rock	pop
"Every moment's a treasure, don't let it fade

Pre-Chorus: I feel that it's hard to find
In the same place every time we touch
I know the path seems empty and hopeless

Chorus:
What you do when nothing makes sense?
Can't take no longer for each mistake
What you have with words I've learned from mistakes
And now I can say right now that I got what you need

Verse 1:
I don't believe in myself
That would hurt me so much
(Oh... oh)
All I did was get your love
This life I choose
So how long until I leave this world behind
Hook:
You came like wildfire
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna stay around 'til everything breaks down (Uh?)
When I was young and weak, it would be such a shame (Yuh huh)
But since then, my strength has grown, and I'm stronger than ever (Mhm)

Pre Chorus x2:
I feel that I must not grow up
As people tell themselves
That maybe I'll always be someone else if I can
'Cause after all the times I chose
Love is all I never really needed
Chorus x6:
What you do when nothing makes sense?
Just walk through my ways, there's no chance at all
What you did was only a dream
Don't have the heart to ask for more"	pop	pop

(Till My Father)

[Pops]
Where's the truth? Where did you see me? (What?) We ain’t have love! You’ve been deceived! (Where's the truth?) We are not meant to be, but still we stay together like this! (How!) What was it about us that made us so special before they tore our home apart?! (How)

I saw your eyes when I was ten-thirty a.m. in my home town, right here on that dusty old highway! I was lost at sea, and I thought of the man behind all of this... why couldn’t they just break up with their plan?! (Why can't they just break up with their plan?), now where the hell do ya believe they really came up with?!


[Sneaky Pete]
Ooohhhh!

(Stood down like a drunken sailor) Yeahhhh

[Harmonizi]
This is my country
Who cares what you say? (It won’t matter)
No one needs no more pity
There’s a lot worse in my life, from the things I hear
But still, oh yeah, well I never asked for nothing
But then again maybe a mother isn’t enough
So I wanna take you to see my side"	country	country

You're too right
You've got to get up, or you’ll break into pieces
Yeah you know that things never work out for you
Oh yeah
(So just let yourself go)
You've got to get up and let yourself go (get up off it all like you wanna feel this good)
Right? (cause in the end there are no ones there who could understand how far we go…)
We come back
We fall in love again
It's nothing new, cause it was you and I
For everything you said to me so very slowly…
I can't help falling in love with you
How were you even tryna reach out?
My mind will be turning inside out on you
And I hope those people around you have gone astray from what they should've been doing
I'll make sure not to think about these words you said one day to me when you didn't see her at school because I told her that you need to learn your worth before telling friends that you don't really care
I had to do something right then that wasn't happening anyway, yeah"	rock	pop
"Under the neon lights, the future is ours
I mean to go and see it in person at the first concert
There's not really an atmosphere here
As if it weren't so important I wouldn't have made it
Oh well
That's what happens when a starless sky becomes too high
A higher star? (yeah)
Yes you had your chances to get out
And then people turned on you cause you left your friends
And you felt down and didn't say anything about the music that you're playing
Well all that really matters is what you show yourself
You got time for everything else that they hate
What makes them say you can do better than everybody else
But they won't stop it cause who are these fakes?
Hook:
Don't care what others think ya gonna do
They just know that they can see it through ya skin. They don't really care how you think ya gonna sound
Do you want to live in the light of a brighter night? You might lose my energy
Can't control myself, no, I'm not trying hard
In my own time and place, we might survive
The music is the only thing we feel alive. Everything has meaning..."	rock	pop
"Every moment's a treasure, don't let it fade
If you're coming back for somethin' special
I hope that you find it as the first song comes out- here all you have to do is listen
All you have to do is listen so, yeah
So give me one more chance before I blow over all my patience
And tellin' you what kind of man will handle these situations, I feel like it's been real hard all on their own
Now let the story begin!


Preceding Intro

Verse 1(Yeah, yeah)


Don't mind me if it doesn't make sense and don't give any proof
It's just me doing this type of thing and I'm gon' die 'till I'm eighty years old
Ain't no money on my shoulder and there ain't nothing I can say about myself anymore
Yuhhh, yuhh... (yeah)


What did I ever do right and why does it feel like I gotta get it over with?
I'm stuck in all sorts of situations all around the globe tryna figure out who had this kid that I met and the fuck I got now
Did everything I possibly could but I fell down so much that I was trapped in a tombstone
Just trying to find the pieces cause I wanna be free at the end of the day...but life never stops because I'm not gonna live my life again
Baby girl, wait up and I'll tell you how wrong I feel when we were through baby girl take your time...this the last of yours and leave me alone"	rock	rap
"What they talkin' 'bout? They ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'

Pre-Verse 1:
It's my time to win some money, I'll try that shit
My mind is focused only how to earn mine
If this beat on your block I'mma blow you. So go get somethin' or get a life check (Yeah!)
And I'm comtin' out today, yung yow leah, leah leah yung!

Chorus:
I will never be the same
I will never be the same just like it started off in the '90s'
Ain't never had a bad girl yet I do it for my own sake (Yah)
But it all starts with love when we fall in love and then it goes from bad to good
So if yuh been wit me then let me know why
Verse 2:
You cannot control it any longer because of these fuckers that put us down. If I said that then I would have said that more, y’all should've seen those messages after the fact...yeah baby
Chorus:
I will never be the same
I will never be the same i'm the new york but I know its gon' lead to you (Good luck finding her)
Because i do what it takes for me to make sure she sees him right in front of her eyes! No matter if it might be the dark or the light(Woo)
Or I dont even know her name, she can't stay no way! She knows her worth(Woah)"	pop	rap
"I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life
I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life
I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life (x2)


Verse 1:
(No I won’t be the one who takes this down like it should)
And every other night I still feel like that a lot
Every other person I miss and even on your birthday they’ve said everything is alright
The best way is out of sight when you look at me, that much I can say to be honest
But honestly, I think I gotta get you off my mind before the lights go out
Cause all I could do was just sit back and watch what happened to me
Like I ain’t got nothing left for me now but a different start
It ain’t over til it’s up again or it’s over till I’m broke with all my pride
To keep myself together all day as long as I hold out my hands
Or am I gonna see somebody new come and kill me? (A new life)
All these problems have never solved or made my whole world turn
I’m feeling so helpless yeah i lost control in a state where things are going wrong
Maybe my only goal is getting married but I really don’t wanna quit
You know how those days go for me
When everyone wants more than you
Then that time has come when we both realize
That it will not last forever baby (yea) oh that’s alright baby
Oh ya yea
Pre-Hook:
Baby, do you remember us?
Do you remember us? Don't play no games
If you don’t remember me baby , tell me why?

Drop the bomb boy take my hand man I gotta let him know (Yeah)
Cause he's better to you than most, that shit feels right baby
Dont go into all your feelings I wouldn’t be that surprised
Let Him love you until your heart goes numb (Yeah)
Take a sip my drink and take my energy away baby
Can't tell if you're loving me cause I thought maybe tonight
Now you'll get your chance you’ll forget what you did to me baby
Can't see that he lied and didn’t deserve you here with me babe
So hold me close then I move on (Right away)
I'm always looking back at all the times that i've wasted
I’m always working hard to live everyday
Keep my head above water just thinking about tomorrow
Cuz there's so many people in our lives that would give anything to make up
But they put work inside them, no matter what we try and do
I'm gonna be alright yeah
Hook:
Cause I guess that’s the end girl
(Tell yo mama goodbye I love ya)
(You never had another dream like yo mama told me that day, bye)
Girl...
Is he just a fool without some respect
(My momma asked where the hell my daddy is)
I just think he went missing and it wasn’t me baby…"	country	rap
"I see the stars align, guiding my way home

Verse 1:

Hear the words
Of a little foe
That's why I'm a bit shy
And I won't stay, you know that I've been there before (Yuh)

Gotta go fast
Yeah that's the plan, gonna find another way
Trying to get past my head and realize it's not enough to go on
Try to give life to it, so if you're thinking of me don't ever worry about what my people say
No one would ever tell, all they do is look at me
Just keep them going because its time for me to find my voice in this life

Pre-Chorus:

It came with the game but now it's all the same
Crawling back down, falling through the pit
But I know how we've changed
When our love was still so strong
Clinging to a promise that you had from your heart again
For me to make it into my dreams
Baby don't let nobody judge you, when you live and breathe and believe
Let's go and do it somehow no matter if it ain't yours or mine if you hate yourself or whatever

Pre-Chorus 2:

How do we grow up after we learn these rules?
Even when you got hurt, you wouldn't want another guy to fix you
So many scars left behind but I don't feel sorry for myself anymore 'cause I don't know how to cope
So much shit inside, always feeling like there's always someone behind me

Chorus:
If all hell was breaking loose
I'd rather be safe with you instead of running away
You made everything so impossible
So what did you think then you went and turned innocent?
When life turned cruel, I really didn't know who I am anymore
So how are we supposed to be together?
What do we say and do we carry more weight in our lives today?
The answer we never have, has nothing to do with us anyway

Hook:
(Hey) Hey hey hey hey hey hittin' right down to you
(Hey) Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hittin' right down to you
(Hey) [Instrumental] (Hey) Hey yeah
Hey yeah
And I'm ready for everything we got to be together. That shit's really simple

Verse:
Everybody knows that there is time
To change this world and make some sense of the things that they're doin.'s the only reason it's so easy...
Why?
Everybody does a lot on their own, and then it feels like they're doing no one else in fact... What's the point of a person if they're just alone? It makes it harder to see the bigger picture. People get lost once in a while sometimes, when they start to realise what they should be. But maybe that would be alright because you'll find people better, they'll learn, they'll understand… but I feel there will ever be someone who can guide you on your way back, who knows anything about the way life go or what happened last night. So let me be clear - all my life I been on a roll and I know it's not fun, I just wanna help everybody out… You gotta treat yourself right. You gotta say a prayer... You gotta get strong before anything else gets you hurt. And don't take anything from anyone except God himself though, especially your sister.. He taught us how to love and live a good life

Preach:
Chorus:
This is where I lay my heart
When all of the world is looking me in the eyes
But this ain't no hard road... To heaven or hell
Yeah

{Bridge:
And then again
There will never be someone who can guide you after all... (Oh-oh-ohh, oh god!)

Verse 2:
There will always be somebody with something to say. Someone with good morals, someone who gives everyone hope of getting ahead but also wants to save others from themselves and maybe you can give them that advice too! So just remember... Every life has different elements. Life is more or less chaotic, there may be no salvation through every circumstance of life. This is just to prove my point! Every man is given a chance, he must take on a responsibility. And nobody can change how he reacts to adversity and what it hurts when he suffers. So you have to remember... I walk with purpose and my life is full enough for me… But sometimes, that means that life will bring you down. So just believe in Yourself"	country	country
"I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life
Verse 1:
My heart is beating fast like a bullet
My fingers are tapping hard into my soul
Even the slightest beat in vain won’t feel anything so sweet
So when i do wanna let it out then just put it behind me while you watch
But all things must always go on, sometimes they take two to decide
You see this feeling right
Ain't no one watching me but your friends and I, it was that
Pre-Chorus:
Now that I’ve got you I know that you’re worth every minute
Let's get to it baby! Let us all get together

I've been waiting for this moment all my life (Oh)
Happened so long and I can't wait 'til I turn 21 years old (Turn 21-)

Girl I know your name cause you look like me (Pretty much always do)
I come with a whole crew every day 'cause I come with a smile (Like okay you got to leave babe baby)

Baby boy I give a damn if you keep showing up at 3 o’clock

You can take advantage though you really need that cash right now

Verse 1:
I heard some folks say it’s okay if you're blackin' or you came from a white background but that goes against reality and my own, right
And I gotta stay in touch with my roots here in my mother tongue like how can I grow when no one has heard of me? In this world we all play the race card sometimes so don’t be deceived
My family’s proud to raise all my brothers and sisters regardless cause no one wants to feel the pressure you put it on to make these streets look better. A different way to live cause if you only saw your daddy standing at the top of an African pyramid you would be saying nothing about getting respect but I got my own sense of purpose so don’t give up cause there’s only so many ways to be who we are

Verse 2 :
I found a love that lives for the struggle while living for those who’ve lost their pride as well as being grateful for what our ancestors do now just to spread our knowledge about life beyond the borders where it comes from so no one is stopping us for our beliefs
And you know life is for young minds it's beautiful if it turns out that's why we do it - You and I that was born into a whole new beginning
My hope is one day your legacy will pave your way to success
Because every time they take pride in not living a life they go and tell everyone that life could be brighter
Don’t believe them so don't try to change their mind or anything it doesn’t have to happen unless it seems right you already believed in it
Catch a wave keep your head above water and follow the flow until you become the man you once were and we ain't waiting for you to come save us somehow

"Every moment's a treasure, don't let it fade
Just look my way, you won't see the point in this no-frills verse

Verse 1:
Every time I make something, it's just cause i got nothing
So when your ex asked why that boy kept on taking pics to Instagram
You told me what he did was so lame they never even looked at him
But girl how could I ever let that go
I'm sorry but that wouldn't happen if we didn't hit it like that
But my life just ain't one where I can't put shit under the sun
Why would I do this again with nothing left?
If everything we've ever had is just a flashback, I should stop thinking about our lives
And get to writing lyrics, then all that shit will be better with time

Chorus:
Life's a dream 'til I drop this crown, but if the world's empty, and you're gone, let us have a piece of mind
If there's something right now that really could really save you from harm
Think about it everyday, oh please listen

Reverse Verse:
Hate yourself? Maybe it's your depression that drives you crazy
'cause all those times you felt you had nowhere to go
Ain't nobody gonna take my hand anymore because these thoughts are killing me
I know that some people wanna say that it's all fake or that their soul's still young
But my story wasn't a joke but honestly I think its sad that my heart's getting old
I need some help, hope I can come home and write some more songs

Yeah i've been waiting for this moment all my life since i walked in and touched your hand
Lying down hoping you're listening to a song about love
Cuz you got me thinking how special you see yourself in this world
Every single girl I try not to date anymore
Why'd they ask that questions when we could talk on the phone and spend forever?
Tryna make them move on me by making you mine
Even when she wasn't as friendly or kind as I used to be
How did i get these feelings inside
Didn’t mean to brag ‘bout sex but all of a sudden
You were loving me before I even knew
Ain’t even saying bye
Don't call back or text me back
Cause girl, you better go ahead and tell him that you don’t really like me anymore

Tell him you didn’t love me
Or maybe you should get an Fendi bikini
Or have a houseboat
Cause girl i feel like I don’t give a fuck why you’re asking me

The day I find out who I am
I hope that I don’t have to run away

If we go home with you baby can hear those footsteps on the walls

Verse 1:
Don't tell me you’re sorry 'cause I just feel a certain way
I really get that feeling right when she opens her mouth at the sight of you walking through town
I know what I’m doing cause I’m here every day and night
Like how did we end up like this?
Baby maybe we should tell ourselves why we had to
Maybe time has come for a change
But it's hard not seeing how good time could turn into
Everything about me I swear to please you
In your body, on my mind I think of you everyday

Chorus:
There is no one to give this one last chance
There won’t be any tomorrow
No one to save us now
You are the only love that ever saved our day
I still wanna hold myself
Everywhere we go you make a promise we’ll make sure forever
Love will always save these kids from dying
Let them live and give the love that was born

Verse 2:
It makes me want to walk away
A dream comes true and then you leave again
And my eyes see a smile growing all around me
And all this pain makes me sick

I'd rather kick out a house than step inside if I know exactly what I wanted to do with my life

I'm a good rapper like Eminem 'cause I flow so fresh like it never existed since the days of my youth up until now
My rhymes keep coming back, always be relevant
With every rhyme I spit at some point I feel like I am born again from them beats, I would love to hear more, oh Lord (Haha)
It's all right, because after all the music has made us stronger, we can finally look back on how strong our country was
I used to hate it when people looked at America as an obstacle to success and made these lyrics about God for us to pass over
At least today is the day that America could finally give it up in a way so that rap couldn't stand before us

If you could save someone else from falling in love with another guy
But girl I never wanna see them cry again
All these girls are crying because they need help
And that ain't cool
When is the last time you showed up at my place?
Are you feeling sad about everything and all ya do now ?
Is there ever hope to live on another man's line ?
It isn't clear
Just when i see myself as a human soul trying to be somebody
Then you become my only one

So no this isn’t me tryna figure out what I ain’t doing but its only natural right there in front of me cause nobody else can feel these feelings I wanna hear (Can I feel this shit it was just too long?)
When we broke up I knew everything would turn around (But honestly why would I change at all? Cause life is tough!)
You say that love equals failure then when you really fall down from your heights you get used to it baby you can put a little faith back in me as I let go for good cause I know I’ve been hurt by every single mistake that you’ve made man I hope you find peace in knowing that we could go forward with being together ohh yeah

When I was just a fucking rapper, no name was my name (Name was my)
Cuz the things that you say to me always feel so fake (Feel so fake)
Like all these girls in my system will try and steal my money with your stupid shit
My main bitch on top of my dome , she really love it when I hop up out the dome

Pour shots on my ex, then we fuck 'round in this big moped truck
Them rappers would do it if they could, not here to impress us, who are these faggots?
No one is above me nigga, it's just me or some phat
It sucks how you treat another nigga 'cause we all suck
How you can't fuck with my team without a couple fucking problems? (Uh)

VERSE 1 : BRIANNA
Yeah i like you, yeah you know what it is
Lemme ride for you girl but i cannot run around round in clubs
And dont mess with anyone who ain't really into cars
Don't be fooled by that girl in yo dress
You want all mine
Baby don't you stop cuz I'm from an island
I think they think they're really hot too, now it's okay
I said get off my dick and make some pussy sounds
Then i'll call lil b
Might be right, but please don't talk to her again
Don't tell no lies, i'm just tryna let them go
But baby come around and start fucking your mans again
I gotta get this bag back then man
I'm making bread like i came from a bag that didn't get filled
Look at me looking down look at Lil G!
All up in his face look at him in amazement
Nigga you already know the truth
And i need you with me never lie
She said she loves you she lied when she said it hurts
Everytime that this bitch pull up in my room it starts to look bad
What i gotta say bitch wait let me slide i swear ima make it rain
That boy jus probably got fucked before he started spanking my niggas last night
Now Imma post like its Halloween
I wanna meet some crazy hoes and see what kinda fun they give that little guy
Just a real young ass nigga i wanna share those photos with my momma
Dont care about nothing else, why you fuckin with me though?
Told her take care of me, told her do what she want, now she cryin
Oh girl, tell dat lil nigga take care of ya son"	rb	rap
"What they talkin' 'bout? They ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
""I don’t care cause that was all I had.""

Verse:
Look you can tell by the way that you speak my tone
You say your life is a stage show but with no real show to perform your stage-manial
That’s a serious understatement ‘cause these ladies are never quite in line
But let them do their thing, so here come the gentlemen who play up their game
If you wanna be the man then you better bring your band wagon
To work until you get a little money for an ad campaign
Be a little rough around the edges, but no matter how hard it will be
Just do them things and you'll see we're not that young

Hook:
Tell em where to get ya food boy (Food boy)
Don't make any noise
Get outta our face don't act funny (Giggle)
When you talking bout what's up when you look at us (Look at us)
Well you really should see just what's done been said (And done been said)
Now listen here
Let me put this song on repeat

Verse 2:
You can see it in the way you make your moves
The way you wear your jeans you get yourself high
Or there is nothing but great intentions
You tryna prove how to impress others but nobody listens
So if we didn’t have that in common then one day that'd change
A lot of people would be down in your corner, they would've loved you more than them

Verse 3:
Well you always keep it poppin’ some weed
And when you feel like you gotta fight it off
Then you kick it right back
Cause all you need to do is just give back!
Cause your soul is full of pride!
When you leave your crib someone can hear you now you are back
So you can go to school, practice music, or just hit the streets!
Make some noise and you know there could be a riot
Let's hope that that's enough to make the world a better place

Hook:
Tell em where to get ya food boy (Food boy)
Don't make any noise
Get outta our face don't act funny (Giggle)
When you talking about what's up when you look at us (Look at us)
Well you really should see just what's done been said (And done been said)
Now listen here let me put this song on replay"	country	rap
"The rain keeps fallin', but the grind don't stop

Versum/Sample:
No one ever really heard me say that
So no one ever really wrote this song,  because
They're just not gonna hear it anyway

If you never write a song 'cause of someone else's mistakes
Then I think of how much trouble we could've made if anyone was trying to put you
In my shoes by pretending that it would take effort and help me get out.I'm scared of trying, because nobody gives advice with no understanding of what they preach to, so I know I gotta stand up next’s gotta be something serious ‘bout all of when they’ll see a sign that makes no difference
This is for the people whose confidence got a knock-kneed in their stride,’ cause I see no way out if we keep on pushing forward or hold back
We push our hearts into the ground and move like stones, and then finally we feel it begin to sink deep inside again. This world it keeps running down my spine. And I can't get out alive either"	pop	rock
"The stars align, but I make my own fate

Song:
The day will come when everything looks exactly like me

All the words of the night are written down on you again
Now you’re in a zone where nothing is ever as it seems
Nothing is ever as it seems

Hook:
And if all the time we had before we met...
When did we meet? When did we meet? ...You know I can be with your mind right here tonight."" (2x)


Verse 1:
I said goodbye to you. Didn't mean too much to you and she
Didn’t say that word about you, she just kept saying shit about her
That wasn't true. It was only words from her
Ain't how much we changed, really not the words were even the same
Cause she wouldn’t leave us alone, and so at least we stuck 'cause there's no one else to blame
But you still think of me over by mistake
And you could be mine, while I’m here waiting for you to grow old
Girl look around, then stare back cause no one seems to notice my name"	pop	pop
"Walking down roads I’ve never seen before
From:

First Verse
I remember living in the hills so high up on this mountain
Getting in fights we would get to hurt a lot more
And then finally coming through out of nowhere and I'm like, no I wasn't ready I guess this was it all in my hands
No time for waste where you need them from
Where you can be when you are stuck underneath another man's skin
You'll find the love that is still present but not forgotten
My whole life been filled with these feelings and emotions while looking around wondering how I had made each day come
And I don't think one single thing about it is what I was thinking or doing anyway (I know)
Hook 2x
All The Memories Lost
All The Memories That We've Seen All The Times
Baby, If You Stay Away From Me
Please Just Stay With Me
In My Dream World Only You Are There I Can Feel It In my Soul and Inside I Feel The Way This Love Is And You Know I Still Care...
When I See You In Sight When You Come Around
Forever Love  Your Life

Pre-Chorus: The lyrics to this track are entirely original
(The real stars!) Don’t judge them for what they say 'cos you can’t define what they mean
I can’t just pretend that I’m the greatest fan alive
If I put it in perspective all my own life I ain't got a choice
'Cos if we don’t live with each other then we never will be friends
Don't blame me not on myself or anyone else but myself
Because I'm so lost inside, losing all hope of finding an escape
But as the world starts to take its place over again
It feels like I've finally found who I am, no one could ever tell which of us’s the best
And here’s why:

Verse 1:
My vision takes a different color than mine in these photographs
Lookin' at the stars I feel much less alive
I think I wanna quit the music and just let up on the drugs

Verse 2:
Don’t judge me for all these mistakes I’ve made
You won’t get a chance to see the truth about me
Cause love is a constant drug, and that's really hard to find when everyone ends up deceased
So where do I begin? There’s nothing else left to prove until your soul is found

Verse 3:
I tried to get through the life before my parents died
I tried to make it to the top without ever even trying
But I couldn’t stop seeing every star that was going up in the sky
From being bigger than me now

Bridge: Every single chapter is a masterpiece! All the words I write were all dedicated with loving hearts

Inverse: I’m the reason that God did his very best
To set me straight in everything I did because He knew that I will make it
And all alone, I had the courage to open up my eyes and read my mind
Even though sometimes I try and hide my demons when I pray
But deep inside, I know something’s gonna be missing soon
I been trying to figure out how I got there, didn’t make it far and I still find inspiration every day
I can't go back, I cannot hide from God

I've been trying to come up from the depths of sin
What happened next? Where did Christ go?
All I can tell me is that Jesus is alive
I don't care if I die tomorrow, I can be saved someday"	pop	country
"From the hills to the valleys, I’m making my way
[?] on your back and we getting older
But I won't take that for granted so don’t you be afraid
I just want you by my side no one else
And I know right away that's what I feel
You're giving in but we both know it too late

Verse 1:
Oh yeah (?) see I’ve been doing fine, I just hope this isn’t all some kind of joke, girl come over here and chill out a while before i go and say something bad (?) tryna move on but at least i'm still alive and ready to die for you to stay with me
It sucks for you cause I never wanted to fuck on you anyway you ain’t even know about
There’s nobody else who'll do the same for you but me and you we gon get married and blow up
Then talk shit and then lie there's no way I'll ever have this conversation again
We wouldn't be friends 'cause we weren't dating anyway they was talking about taking shots to my head
This is the type of feeling you only feel when you think of love, now tell me why am I so fucking sad?
Saying, where the fuck are we going now what’s the point?
All these guys trying to act nice because they wanna make our lives better like they deserve it, they need another reason why
So please don't cry if you can and just give them time until you understand exactly what we do as human
(Chorus)"	rock	rb

Outro Verse 1:

Aye, it’s that world I love the most
Where people come and they go but no one loves me this much
That’s why I came from the west to play
It's not because of what you say on Twitter or Facebook (No)
We all speak out and we try to do our best but now we're standing in this house alone (We are)
That's why when I stand right here with my head up high, it feels great being around ya guys
People want help just like nobody else can help us
Even if it ain't the government or some kind of thing, the people there help us too
I don't wanna be treated as a second-class citizen
The world should respect me even though they tried to tell me
Let’s make sure every kid knew his rights
There for him to have a chance to move forward but still they treat him like nothing at all
I just feel like I'm waiting for somebody to come to my life
It isn't hard cause I got nothing left to lose
But maybe next summer, I could make some money off this country
Well guess what? I just hope I can find myself a job and get me a new girl
In another couple of years I might find myself working in a field full of women
Somebody would really appreciate it if I made it right by these girls"	country	pop
"Every moment's a treasure, don't let it fade
Never mind if its real or a fake
Always keep the message high and be aware
I can understand why you think that is impossible to do

Why do people always turn away? How did you forget what happened?
Life can happen for free when one person gives and it can go to hell when two people give right away
You should've known better at times
But you were wrong for being so honest with yourself
You should have taught yourself more...

Output:
Every moment's a treasure, don't let it fade
Never mind if its real or a fake
Always keep the message high and be aware


What happens in your sleep
When he wakes up
When you say he's gone
Everything changes
Like he gets lost inside his mind


So you must do something about it
Cause you know that you can't make no sense of it
You need a change of attitude
Don't get involved in anything


Tell 'em how you're feeling
If they'll let you live by their code
Make sure that you understand what your worth is
Just remember...don't tell em i'm scared of them

Verse 1 :
How the heck i got outta there?
I guess most times it doesn't matter anyway
Your friends are in and out of town
People who really want to talk to ya
Are always in your way
But you never cared what you felt or what you didn't see
I never wanted somebody to find me lonely
Yeah i thought you would listen, but you never showed me kindness
But now you're lying on the floor thinking thats all you got
No, I ain't just saying this because its real
But it's not you!"	country	pop
