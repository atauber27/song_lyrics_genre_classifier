"[Verse 1: Egypt Dean & Alicia Keys]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Ooh (Ooh,ooh)

[Chorus: Egypt Dean & Alicia Keys]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's wherе you'll find me

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Somewherе over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh, why can't I? I-I ooh
[Vocal Bridge: Both]
Ooh (Ooh,ooh)
Hmm hmm
Ooh (Ooh,ooh)
Ooh (Ooh)
Hmm hmm

[Outro: Egypt Dean, Both]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?"	rb	rb
"Oh, everybody
How you can look I'm trying hard

Everytime I try to feel right with my soul

"I dont't care about diamond rings
All the money won't make me sing
Lovin you's my mission
You're born to be my sweet thang

I don't care about superstars
I just wanna be where you are
For your recognition
You're born to be my sweet thang

Hey, boy, listen now
When I saw you the first time
You really blew my mind
You made me fly high in the sky
Like a butterfly
The whole world out of sight
Do you wanna know
What I did when I came down
I fell in love with you
And now I just do here for you
Something really new
Another girl will never do
I dont't care about diamond rings
All the money won't make me sing
Lovin you's my mission
You're born to be my sweet thang

There is no way to keep out
The love that's meant for you
And if you get sick here's a trick
Just another kick
My love will be the cure
And we're riding on
Any beam of the sunlight
The rainbow and the stars
We're getting around hear the sound
Never touch the ground
And stay the way we are

Hey boy let me show you all the miracles
Hey boy I just wanna get physical
And now I just do here for you
Something really new
Another girl will never do

I dont't care about diamond rings
All the money won't make me sing
Lovin you's my mission
You're born to be my sweet thang
People say we are dreaming
And we won't make it through
That it's all about
Getting rich, making money
Doing business, life is cruel, but
If I get your heart, the ace is my card
And I'll never be blue, so come on and just
Put away all fears - right now
Let them cry their tears - alone
Hey boy let me show you all the miracles
Hey boy I just wanna get physical
Hey boy let me show you all the miracles
We do it all night and we'll never be stopped

I dont't care about diamond rings
All the money won't make me sing
Lovin you's my mission
You're born to be my sweet thang

I don't wanna get back to bed
Wanna take you to church instead
Where we do french kissing
You're born to be my sweet thang

I don't care about superstars
I just wanna be where you are

You're born to be my sweet thang"	pop	country

"[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you?)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said ""speak now""

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Chorus - Variation]
And you’ll say
""Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door""
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
""Speak now"""	country	pop
"[Verse 1]
Girl when you look my way
You got me feeling, feeling some kind of way, ay
And I don't wanna play no games
Your body is senting, I can't let you walk away, no
I know, I see it in your eyes
You have the guts cuz your ex is nice
Trust me baby we could take time
We could take it slow
No lie, I can't deny
But a bruddah can't help but fantasise
Your eyes, your thighs, oh my x3

[Hook] x2
So tell me what you saying baby
Won't you come my way
I know how you feeling, oh na na na

How long you got a man waiting
For you, I got a lot of patience
I'll swim the deepest ocean
On a sunny day I'll rub you some lotion

When the wind blows through your hair
I can't help myself, help myself but to stare
So please dont get me wrong
All the thoughts in my head
What I wanna do with you, yeah
Them bruddahs can wait in line
Hating on me cuz your giving me time
Imma make it worth your while
No regrets no
I guarantee that you will see
You ain't gonna find no one better than me
My side, tonight, oh my x3

Take your clothes, you'll be back by the evening
And if I'm lucky you'll be back in the morning

"Oh maybe it won't be soon
I can see it in your eyes
But oh, Tarzana, call me when you change your mind
Oh you said it was you
Or just a shitty time
No, not a single heartfelt line

But I'll remember you
When the fear is heavy
When your cheek rubs off of mine
No, I won't be sad
I just wish we never had been

So now I'm asking you
When will you leave me be
Oh, Tarzana, give me separation please

But I'll remember you
When the fear is heavy
When your cheek rubs off of mine
No, I won't be sad
I just wish we never had been
I was afraid of us in ways I'd never known
We never spoke the way you kissed me on the phone
I don't miss you, no I like being alone
No, I'm not sad
I just wish we never happened"	country	pop
"Keep that check if it don’t come with commas

"[Verse 1: Kamaliza]

Took a while to get used to
But I got you in my blood now
About to get lifted
I'll call you when I touch down
Flyin’ through clear sky
See the curves of the sand dunes
Lost oceans weave through my mind
Gold mixed with warm blue
Showing things that you never showed me
Galaxies when you stare
Sentimental, never lonely
Green aura, raven hair
Take me for granted &
I'm quick to go
But, say words so softly and...
Watch how I glow

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kamaliza]
Is it wrong of me
If I play for keeps
Are your dreams alive
Does it hurt to sleep
I move forward
Just to know your name
I was wondering
If you felt the samе
[Chorus: Kamaliza]
Let's go yeah let's slidе
Anywhere you want to hit
We can ride to
You roll, while I drive
I just want to spend time while the skies blue
They don't know you like I, do
I love the way you’re
You, so warm and yet so cool

[Verse 2: Kamaliza]

And now you really got my soul light
Uncovered your bones, it makes me wonder
How I ever found you
Orbiting around you
Talk through to the morning but silence is our friend, I
Reset the status quo
I don’t have to pretend
Like I don't need you
Walls up but you see-through
Stitched up but I bleed through
New words from a black ink pen...
You know you make it feel so real
Finally free to be myself
Watch me exit from this shell
Give me time I will unfurl
[Pre Chorus 2: Kamaliza]
Is it wrong of me
If I play for keeps
No more surfaces
Show you underneath
I move forward, from an altered state
You are different, they are all the same

[Chorus: Kamaliza]
Let's go yeah let's slide
Anywhere you want to hit
We can ride to
You roll, while I drive
I just want to spend time while the skies blue
They don't know you like I, do
I love the way you’re
You, so warm and yet so cool

"Verse 1
The Accidental miracle, somewhat spiritual and lyrical
The revolt of the robots got the system sprung, and I'm only 16 years young
I leave a black taste on your tongue
These kids are brainwashed by cathedrals and lack liberals. They can't dignify right or wrong, they just sing along
I'm self conscious, no fear of the consequence
Look at my soul illuminate, I'm part of the chosen fate, my nigga you ain't safe so you pose as bait
This generation is preposterous, that's why my world is full of darkness, you all must've lost this
They're stuck in austerity, can't seem to see the clarity
Third eye vision, set the division. A better view, stick your feet off the glue. Think for your own, don't be a clone
Lies from your parents and teachers, rape from the preachers
They don't determine who you are, focus on going far
A new form of rebels, to set sail and unleash hell
A generation of prophets, searching for a profit, money makes me vomit
I'm riding on that astral plane, we aren't the same. On a different genre, 7 aligned chakras
Learn to use what you've got, Shit it's not a lot
Women advertising their chest, rather then showing them what's best
They're acting depressed, wanting to be caressed
They seek attention, I seek Ascension
Here to guide em to the light, make sure they prosper to fight
Seek new sights, reach higher heights, it's your life. Do what you think is right
Verse 2 [PhantAzmic]
Time to form an indigo plot
Open your mind, become invincible before your brain rots
A generation of ignorance forgetting morals
Prophecies from the past are never told to you
Rage against the machines, free the robots, build self-esteem, don't fall into su-su-supreme, box logos box you out of your dreams, so please just believe... In yourself
Before you're seized by the fakes, blood thirsty for wealth
Economic situations society can't help
Turnin' up every night ain't good for my health,Blood pressure shoots through the roof, While the depth of problems drown in alcohol
Racial slurs dripping from under they jaws, Life is like a show, Cool kids act like assholes
Arrogant mothafuckers left under the spotlight, That ain't right, Give it some time, As I extend my positivity to the next move, My Fluorescent attitude gone leave you shook like the next crook
""I pray for y'all going through this, to find yourself, progress, hit or miss, & deny the antagonists around you."" Here's a cast for the pain yo brain has suffered from watchin' broads off the broadcast, Channel surfin' ain't easy while I'm on the wax/Trips to the galaxies & back, Fuck Thot, simply crack down the media
Brainwashed like broken toy soldiers, fuck the guide Ima fold it up
Backtrack to my euphoria
While it's just you & I & the world's against us"	rap	rap

You killed the industry

You take for granted all the people that support what you do
You're not a rockstar and you will never be

What?,where?,are you sure?swear down?
You're there now?Don't lie, don't cry, i'll try.Bye
Cell(Whats good) they raided my mums yard
They ran up in there with straps
They're saying its a gun charge
I'm pissed but I'm praying its a dumb sarge
Or they find the gun parked in the mud
In the front yard
And my whites underneath it
My browns right beside it
My wife tried to hide it
When OD supplied it
And if the sniffer bitch gets a sniff of bricks
Then I know that they'll find it
And I still can't rest assured
Cos if they check the second drawer
In the Chest of Drawers,they're bound to find
They best of a draw
And when my mum and gyals is to together
They're always on a hype so
I know that they'll test the law
Wait, hold on I got a text
They cuffed my mum and gyal
And my little sisters next?
That ain't fair, wait hold on
That will only happen if they think its theirs
Man I've never had a day like this
I hope the rest of the hours don't stay like this
Whats the date? The 28th I should've been a court
And wasn't allowed to top it all off, I gotta worry
[Chorus]
Like I stepped on three drains
Whilst under a ladder
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror
Walking through a pole
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th

Like I stepped on three drains
Whilst under a ladder
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror
Walking through a pole
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th

[Verse 2: Cell 22]
I'm having a bad day, feeling a bad way
I want that dirty money so
My bread get buttered sideways
Things are going wrong
I don't know whats going on
My lucks bad I'll cut and stab
If I don't get my dough its on
I tell them my lucks bad they just ignore me
Until I start, I start walking like Jason Voorhees
I got a sick brain its double
So I stepped on six drains with 22 black cats
Whos insane? Its bray I'll go mega on you darg
Come to your crib, and buss an umbrella in your yard
I dare you to try a ting
If you don't like me
You'll look like an arsenal fan
When I'm done with your white Tee
If I'm having bad luck, someone gets
Gabbed up,Tied up, Pied up blindfold
Eyes closed, grabbed up, stabbed up
Guess its just the bad luck
I lost out on 22 grams when I bagged up
I want that dirty money
Thats all thats on my mindstate
I'll be damned, I'm not Usher
But I want it my way
They skies are grey, a bad day
I stabbed the bray for Chrissakes
Take his girl, I left him as a statistic in the crime rates
These nuckers keep on watching me
They're looking at my watch for greed
They want my bling and in my girl they
Wanna drop a seed,nah thats not happening
Thats the perfect bad day
Man will be left in the hospital
Hurting in a bad way
[Chorus]
Like I stepped on three drains
Whilst under a ladder
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror
Walking through a pole
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th

Like I stepped on three drains
Whilst under a ladder
I saw a black cat, broke a mirror
Walking through a pole
Saw a magpie fly just above my reach
And all of this happened on Friday the 13th"	rap	rap

He must have seen some ugly things

Got a job in town
Sellin' insurance on the phone

Everybody is so busy doin' this and doin' that
Something has gone missin'
And it makes me kinda sad, oh

Heard about the day
That two skyscrapers came down
Firemen, policemen
And people came from all around
The smoke covered the city
And the body count did rise
The president spoke words of comfort
With teardrops in his eyes
Then he led us as a nation
Into a war based on lies, oh

And a handful of senators can't pass legislation
When money corrupts the value of elections

And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
No, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Take a look around to Selma, Alabama
Yeah, you might leave here for four days in space
When you return, well, it's the same old place

You can bury your dead, don't you dare leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace

Just another white boy staring at the stars
And when I turned 39 me and the boys we hit the sky
And headed where they’d never been before

One small step for man, Jesus, Goddamn
22 hours hanging in the air
Sometimes you take the fame, sometimes you sit backstage
But if it weren’t for me them boys would still be there

When it came time to land, them boys they shook my hand
They said, “we’ll call you up when we need a ride”
They went down to the ground, and I floated around
With all them stars still twinkling in my eyes

Now the history books will write about that fateful night
Them two fellas dancing on the moon
But they won’t say nothing bout me, waiting patiently
To bring them boys safely back home to you

But what if there's more?
This is the place I always end up
Like I never really reached that top
Only a leap away from the highest ledge
Just a leap away from giving up again

I never learn from my misstakes
No matter what I say
I never want to feel this way again

You know this awkward moment
When you see yourself through different eyes
Maybe I should listen, and maybe try to learn some too
Only a leap away from my greatest fear
Just a leap away from giving up again

I never learn from my misstakes
No matter what I say
I never want to feel this way again
Everytime that I've tried, and everyone left behind
Will always haunt me, will always haunt me down
No matter what I do, no matter if I try
It always haunts me, it always haunts me down

No matter what I say
I never want to feel this way again

"Cybernetics
Merger between two worlds
Biologic and mechanical spheres collide
As a result the new breed is created
That is superior to anything we know
Human beings created the machine
And the machines create themselves
Is this artificial intelligence or simply intellect?

Technology within our genetics
Comparative study of mechs and mankind
Dissecting familiar artificial systems
How long can we inhibit this process
They are designed to control themselves
A.I. is something that I.A.created
Technology within our genetics
A.I. is something that I.A.created

Incapable of producing thought

Created in the same way machines were born

Get back in line it's not you're turn
And it never will be
Breeding drone beings
Perfection deformed
No steps forward
It's just circular
Life in cycles
Humans disposed
Borgs will take our place
In the next wave of evolution
Eradicate your own god

One step forward ten steps back

"The rakes of mallow

Beauing, belleing, dancing, drinking
Breaking windows, cursing, sinking
Every raking, never thinking
Live the Rakes of Mallow;
Spending faster than it comes
Beating waiter's bailiffs, duns
Bacchus' true begotten sons
Live the Rakes of Mallow

One time naught but claret drinking
Then like politicians, thinking
To raise the ""sinking funds"" when sinking
Live the Rakes of Mallow
When at home, with da-da dying
Still for mellow water crying;
But, where there's good claret plying
Live the Rakes of Mallow
Racking tenants stewards teasing
Swiftly spending, slowly, raising
Wishing to spend all their days in
Raking as at Mallow
Then to end this raking life
They get sober, take a wife
Ever after live in strife
And wish again for Mallow

America’s favorite anti-transcendentalist
We’re taking this back, way back, nineteenth century style

CHORUS
Who’s that (who’s that) rapping?
Who’s that rapping at my chamber door?
Mr. (mister) Raven!
All up in my grill like, “Nevermore.”

Kick it! Once upon a midnight dreary, while I kicked it weak and weary
Dark and cold just like Lake Erie, Brand New sample, someone clear me
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
Up like, “What?”, this thunder clapping in my brain like graphic Halflings
Staffing me, I put down Milton. Cell phone mute like Paris Hilton
Open window, halfway built-in. Times a changing like Bob Dylan
Twenty-pound bird black as could be, cold feet cold eyes aimed straight at me
Grim face, grim stare, death carnivore, quothe that raven “Nevermore.”

REPEAT CHORUS
I miss Lenore, my Annabel Lee, taken by angels from me
Alone with books (hey that’s me!), harbinger of death visiting me
“Can I help you, evil prophet? If you got a problem, look, I’ll solve it.”
He checked my hook, DJ revolved it, perched on Pallas, chalice dropped it
“Tell me sir, please, if you can. Am I good or evil man?
What can I say, what can I do, when will I be rid of you?”
“Nevermore,” quothe he at me, hating on this fresh MC
Satanic raven, Nietzsche glee, killing me softly like the Fugees
Now I feel worse, my verse is terse, joy inverse just like Fred Durst
Call a nurse, disperse my thirst put this process in reverse
Wish I'd had some warning first, MC Lars, ’88 hearse
Now I’ll never be Slug or Murs, under that black raven’s curse
The raven's eyes still have the seeming of a demon that is dreaming
Lamplight over him still streaming, hear my screaming, hear me screaming!
My soul still floats there on that floor and shall be lifted nevermore

Another bottle down just to pick me up
I've found rock bottom in this empty cup

Am I the life of the party or killing a good time?

They say in all of us, there's a sinner and a saint
You'll meet one or the other based on how much I've drank
I lost my mind but found my heart
In this congregation kissing bar top art

For me, there's no heaven after all
I've been in a dark place
But the holy spirit never burned as bright as alcohol"	rock	country
"[Verse 1]
Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
I've learned what love's about
And this time I'll be ready
When love comes around

[Chorus]
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around

[Verse 2]
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can see now I let it down
But if love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
[Chorus]
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around

Yeah, I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around"	country	rb

I kept it all inside
Swore you'd be back someday
My sin is pride

I could have reached out to you
But I felt like my hands were tied
I’m always bound to prove
My sin is pride

Wasted so many words
When I told the truth I lied
I never will confess
My sin is pride

I've chosen a narrow path
Lost sight of the road so wide
But I never will look back
My sin is pride

Nobody sees the pain
Nobody knows I've cried
I never will confess

I never will confess

I drink way too much for my body I know I'm a mess
Party after party tryna cover up the pain you left
And the more I think about it I find myself full of regret
But I just drink to stop thinkin but oh I can't forget

And no I never believed in forever that's a mighty long time
But of course I believed what you said when you said you were mine
Wish I could believe this is a lesson and yeah, i'm gonna be fine
But I keep praying and waiting for the day we move counterclockwise

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd go back
My worst fear you know that
Was being here while I dont have
What you want, what he don't lack
Tried but it just won't past
Shit just makes me so mad
Never thought you'd go back
You know what hurts so bad
[Post Chorus]
You used to be so sweet
You used to be so sweet
You used to be so

"Falling voices calling
Of a dear old dream
Sliding, drifting, writhing
Time is wild it seems

Come and see my church and my steeple
Thousands of people are praying
Why, join a part in your head in your heart
In the garden where children are playing

Come, chant and sing, drink my wine, wear my ring
Cast my ashes in front of another
Don't refill my cup, you can kill me
And leave by the stairs in the rear

Time you met my choir and my rector
Building inspector is leaving
Come check it out, you've been hearing about it
And now there's no time left for brеathing

Come, hang around, throw my pride on the ground
Can't you see thеre were others before me?
Please ignore my truth, you can buy me
And leave by the stairs in the rear
Rise to fall, no hope, only glory
Telling the story too many
Times that I've cried after being denied
By the spirits who weren't having any

Sleep in my bed, break your heart, waste your bread
But be sure not to hear what I'm saying
Don't refill my cup, you can kill me
And leave by the stairs in the rear

Slipping, falling deeper
Back into the wild
Sliding, drifting, gliding
While you rock good night"	rock	rock
"[Verse 1]
I thought it
Was over, for me until you made your
Way back
And asked me how's things?
I thought you had a boyfriend
Or did he leave on loose ends
‘Cause you don’t really make sense
To me

[Pre-Chorus]
We both seem to be crazy
But it can never be a simple thing
And she says you can't save me
‘Cause she knows I don't really wanna commit

[Chorus]
‘Cause we could go to Seoul
We could make it work out, if you like
‘Cause I don’t wanna burn out, in the sun, when it's too bright
And we could go to Paris
Help me work on all those, little things
‘Cause I don't wanna burn out, in the sun, when it's too bright
[Verse 2]
Was that it
Just small talk, that's all?
I don't know why you'd show up
If nothing was up
I really thought you moved on
But now you mention my song
You really mess with my head
You do

[Pre-Chorus]
We both seem to be crazy
But it can never be a simple thing
And she says you won't save me
‘Cause she knows I don’t really wanna commit

[Chorus 2]
‘Cause we could go to Seoul
We could make it work out, if you like
‘Cause I don’t wanna burn out, in the sun, when it's too bright
And we could go to Paris
Help me work on all those, little things
‘Cause I don’t wanna burn out, in the sun, when it's too bright

I remember
All the tears that you shed
And I couldn't help so I wrote that song instead
Too make you care

We both seem to be crazy
But it can never be a simple thing
And she says “you won't save me”
‘Cause she knows I don’t really wanna commit

‘Cause we could go to Seoul
We could make it work out, if you like
‘Cause I don't wanna burn out, in the sun, when it's too bright

Was I in denial thinking that you
Were my end-game, undone with blame

Well maybe I failed 'cause I took the bait
If I found you out, where would I be now?
In the arms of betrayal

What if I was never with you
Maybe today I'd have nothing to lose
What if I started trusting myself
Maybe I'd be here with somebody else
What ifs and maybes ain't gonna save me
What ifs and maybes ain't gonna break me

The smile you were faking pulled me in close
All along you were making me look like a joke
Now I can't feel, don't know what's real
The smile you were faking

Maybe today I'd have nothing to lose
What if I started trusting myself
Maybe I'd be here with somebody else

Now it's me that's hurting myself
So what's on me, what's on you
So what's on me, what's on you

"American cities kissed by open sky
While the years scrape at your skin
Spending your whole life trying to erase
The person you know you’ve been

Holding on to every single breath
Chased by nicotine
Walking away from a future
Led in the pursuit of buying things

Sometimes the lips don’t need to move
For the heart to make a desperate sound
If I’m hell bound
Come on light this body up and we’ll burn it down
Because you know a bruise only lasts
Long enough for thе pain to pass

Getting buried in the day to day
Scarеd of how it feels
Hoping someday that this town repays
Everything it steals
Holding on to every single breath
Watching your friends get old
Your scars can tell you about where you’ve been
But not where you need to go

Sometimes it takes giving up everything
To see the things you really need the most"	rock	pop

Waiting out the pain. Waiting on

Learned to play and then to cheat her
Busy hands they kept my mind at peace

So inevitably
