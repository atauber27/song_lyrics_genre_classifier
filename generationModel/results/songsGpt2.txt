"Y'all get a hold of the keys to success but what's the meaning with being successful?"

Verse 1: (2Pac)

I'm just tryna put in some work, no longer afraid to walk in this store, I got that passion, so don't waste my time trying to go around and fight me or tell you who I think you should be
I'd rather kick out a house than step inside if I know exactly what I wanted to do with my life

I'm a good rapper like Eminem 'cause I flow so fresh like it never existed since the days of my youth up until now
My rhymes keep coming back, always be relevant
With every rhyme I spit at some point I feel like I am born again from them beats, I would love to hear more, oh Lord (Haha)
It's all right, because after all the music has made us stronger, we can finally look back on how strong our country was
I used to hate it when people looked at America as an obstacle to success and made these lyrics about God for us to pass over
At least today is the day that America could finally give it up in a way so that rap couldn't stand before us

I ain't tryna make it big

It don't come without worry

(Hook) X2
Don't worry bout how you feel

Verse 2:
Now here I stand in amazement
All this power that makes us all
There's just too many people in this world now
Not everyone has to earn it all then have it
See, people don't have to be paid
Instead, they look from every city, place, and everything
To tell them what to do so they can succeed
They think it's cool 'til they're rich, so they give up on it
In fact, when you've been there for far too long
You know one day you'll realize you gotta get away from this game
Your life gotta win

Guitars & Chorus from Snippet

(Dirty Diggs):
My name is Dirty Diggs and we killin' for the show
We rollin weed when we come out the hood
Everybody wants somethin good because we never die
Now where my homies at? Where my homies at nigga huh
Do you think I’m really trynna bring fame to the hood and still leave the streets cold? How much did we spend just to see a kid
Why these cops wanna murder? Tell ‘em I done gave them my baby face and no more beefs
What are y’all goin' thru when all around me is all these kids in jail
I should've stayed home and spent my nights in the sheets while i was livin'
Tell mama whatcha gon' do now she wanna live for her whole life
Get paid well girl don’t need no check, just be rich until the night before a fuckin' fight
This lil dirty kid could stay by his job til he learn how hard work pays
I ain't never fucked around when I runnin' with my gangsta crew
Shit hit so hard we had to split niggas limbs and split bodies
The way I live thuggin' without a lot of smoke in this hood I feel like a victim to crime
In a place where nobody speak, they hear the loudest niggas talking too loud
Let me tell 'em stop talking! Who gonna talk bout whatchu been through? I didn't start this shit, damn why you think I went and did this?!

Chorus :
What they talkin' 'bout? They ain’t talkin' 'bout nothin'

You better move fast cause they can follow you round the block like a traffic
If God ever blesses anybody he’ll surely bless me too


Hook-2: (K.R.K. Kalevas):
She wanna be with me when she horny but she always act funny
Who cares if she was takin pictures or was in there acting mad like you were crazy
She wanna be with me when she horny, and I know that I am in it but everyday I think about dying
When she came around I knew I won’t fall short of the next great boss
She said she wanna watch movies when imma go in like my mother died
I told her fuck with niggas thats who I wanna ball with
He said don’t let dem bitches touch thos though and pass the cake
I told her stop talkin out your mouth like my grandma tried to chill with an ill bitch

Verse:
Look you can tell by the way that you speak my tone
You say your life is a stage show but with no real show to perform your stage-manial
That’s a serious understatement ‘cause these ladies are never quite in line
But let them do their thing, so here come the gentlemen who play up their game
If you wanna be the man then you better bring your band wagon
To work until you get a little money for an ad campaign
Be a little rough around the edges, but no matter how hard it will be
Just do them things and you'll see we're not that young

Hook:
Tell em where to get ya food boy (Food boy)
Don't make any noise

Well you really should see just what's done been said (And done been said)
Now listen here
Let me put this song on repeat

Verse 2:
You can see it in the way you make your moves
The way you wear your jeans you get yourself high
Or there is nothing but great intentions
You tryna prove how to impress others but nobody listens
So if we didn’t have that in common then one day that'd change
A lot of people would be down in your corner, they would've loved you more than them

Verse 3:
Well you always keep it poppin’ some weed
And when you feel like you gotta fight it off
Then you kick it right back
Cause all you need to do is just give back!
Cause your soul is full of pride!
When you leave your crib someone can hear you now you are back
So you can go to school, practice music, or just hit the streets!
Make some noise and you know there could be a riot
Let's hope that that's enough to make the world a better place

[Verse 1]
All alone in this lonely night
And my heart is still like the morning sun
Tell me now how long it will take before I can see
Don’t worry about him when my heart is steady beating

You are the one who's gonna make us feel alright
Girl come through tonight and I guarantee you won't feel alright

Verse 1:
In the city I lived in my dream, had to go in, then I went back where it started

Got a new car, broke off a new part and I was stuck with no place to go, so I threw it to the side, now she's gone and that's all I want to do, if only for you to be proud of it, baby why am I not still yours?

I was just in London from '08 through '14, I didn't know any better than people would see me like this! That is how I fell back into love with her – she wasn't even sure if she knew it, so she ran away. She couldn't care less about anyone else, there was nothing she could do. She knew everything! Well, it doesn't get much better without her company and she wanted you to know by now that as far as we were apart, now I'm so sad what I'm gonna do now-now (now I miss you!)

Hook:
If only I could let you be the one who made the heart ache when I was young

So please, please don't forget me though!
Oh yes; make it easy for us to find our way again together

So where's J? He's at his house right outside of town talking to himself, how I hate myself for being him, but I really am glad I said that he loved me, now as much as anyone I still wanna love him (Yeeeah)

Verse 1:
Tell yourself that it could be a waste of time
Not even once should you even be trying to be your own worst enemy
For someone like yourself
That just wants to be around other peoples feelings and isn't even able to hold them against themselves when they feel hurt
A man who says he cares for you is not a person or anybody
You have been there so long feeling like everyone else
If I could leave you now I'll probably be fine, though I may have a couple things I'd rather say
Don't ever let it define your feelings towards me

Verse 1:

My world is full of pictures. They remind me when I was eleven
That everything around me made me want to leave the house
I always loved the clothes - just because
They make me feel so different from most kids
I loved when my mom left daddy and I just took my time to remember her name
Took my first heart - but then daddy called and said…
(Oh yeezeahhh)

I felt so alone - I just took my first kiss on purpose
She would talk to me but I knew I wasn't doing enough
Baby girl I hate myself... but I thought I could give back just a little
But then I found out a very strange thing happened - that I lost my best friend my whole life ago
So I got rid of him all together... and my life started in a better place
Cause he taught me not to be selfish without thinking of it...

I cried alot, I cried much more times
Just wanted to be happy forever more, right? Right?

But then he told me something deep inside of me
That the only thing left to show me was he was really with his baby
What am I supposed to do if I don't love my mommy?
It's been a month since she's gone, shit isn't nothing alike
But baby i will try....

Lyrics

Trying to get myself to sing more than we think and believe in but there's none for me or anyone else here - all I know, at least to hear, is so clear

You better listen, I was waiting on you to tell my story
I was waiting on you to say it on repeat, this time every single night and day
I was ready just to stand here, in line with what was to come
But, right, here, right here
There's no-one to ever change that's how it's been, man
And, boy, they've seen, what comes first - the things that go through to a good end

Yeah, well, I thought so
I would've believed

I don't really care though
Just because if somebody said something stupid - it's always gonna be true
Nobody knows what will be heard, nothing can, nobody knows any way back of me
This world has been so unfair, and I know that I'm not meant to live this life I'm living
So, when someone said, "You gotta run away for your soul", I knew that would mean
Someone took my soul - it would surely, and, yeah, I did
With tears in my eyes and tears in my blood
Now everyone knows... I have no idea what was meant to last
It was no secret

They told their secrets too often
Couldn't keep them out

I've been waiting a whole day for your arrival at every sound to come on. You always keep the words written in my lungs and tell me that I'm going through hell but you make it all come alive - do you really think that
Don't feel some sympathy with when I say goodbye or we might be alone forever?
Cause I can hear the sound of love coming like an angel singing into our lives. I have no choice before this show
Your song is not only catchy but also something like heaven sent or heaven sent - whatever you call it... it's in your DNA

Pre chorus :
If she asks how the sun will go down - then I'll just give her mine
It seems like nobody knows even though I don't know anyone yet who has heard more from us than me - oh let's stop playing hide and seek
As time makes it happen each and every word in your voice comes out as one beautiful song to me
We don't have to fight so please hold your breath while feeling like I'm finally home again

Verse 1:
I'm the one getting all these compliments over music because it got me so stressed out just to get my shit together that's been going on and on about my life since I met you. I'm not an original nigga or nothing like that, Im just having fun every day but I promise I feel special because of it. I don't really wanna be single dude cause everybody has different stories than me when they tell me what the fuck I believe in, That's it... Like that. [?] where we livin' as equals. That's kinda how things started. Everybody know that is the fact that everything about us is always fucking irrelevant. Who would ever care if I told you that I can't give you shit? No nobody with no fucking heart can ever live this way right now, So it's up to you. You should know that I love you bro. Tell me what you want bro. That's right, Just take me back to when times could have been better. Ain't that selfish? Cause thats exactly what you were taught by your parents. And at the end the saddest thing for me is people tryna tell me that I'm bad man cause that's all I can say and I gotta let people understand because I don't do that myself. I've had enough of being around all of these haters tryna come out screaming that I'm sorry to none of them niggas that tried to shut me down on some shit. Fuck it man
Troubled:
That's right.. My nigga, I need to go back, I needn't do this again! But then again.. People hate on 'em man
Feverz & Niggas
Matter offact:
Ain't it funny how when I fall I think I was too young to do it? Because I grew up loving that kid and knew he was perfecting his craft of music that used to be called pop and rap so why is that? He wasn't doing stuff anyplace good to me, I'mma say how the fuck did this happen in the past that made his heart stop beating out of his chest? His lungs start choking because there was nothing he could do while he lay down dying. He spent years at a young age trying to figure out his way back home to his mommy who needed him, so that's why I'm still here, to put this together so that this isn't fucked up

Maybe I should have stayed to give them all these memories
We could just start over with something real
Maybe we never talked to each other, I could keep it secret
Tell me why would you do nothing for me
All these stories I was given, not one of which ended up in the news
How did I ever stop believing? You couldn't tell a true story about yourself
When I met you at my music convention
I told you i had your back, when you said you wouldn't let me go
Don't forget it happened so fast baby, time to run away from this heartache

Yo girl told me that she wanna have a lil fun but I had to hit her like 5 times for every second since we met cause she always knew better than to lie
We was chillin' at the bar after having sex just sitting there drinking from her juice. I bet you heard the one that said, fuck that bitch too much
Then she ran away looking for love, yeah her man took his life and she was feeling sad as hell. He was in bed crying like a boy trying desperately to explain what happened to him. It didn't last forever because all these tears came raining down from his eyes (Haha)

Tryna find some time for myself to just forget, yeah
When we break up this time again, will I fall in love like the first time? Yeah (Yeah)

So when will you know? When will you find out
If your only thing good is being strong
And living in a world where I just might die
Is it me? Is it all or is life's worth?
Do these people who are so kind
Circles and valleys between them
Falling as hard against the world as their names
We stand on the crest of our own race, we have to see
What can we learn from humanity's mistakes
The things we've done
And I won't be sitting here for long
When my time comes

I will never let you down again
I'll make you mine forevermore
Love, love me too!
Let you get away with all the hate we've been through

(My days may pass fast)
I tried, almost nothing
So when will you give up?
Why keep trying all you got anymore

Just sit there while it passes
Until one day you finally see this
It could be us together
If we work until we reach this
If we grow up and realize we've found a way
But we'll never achieve anything
Don't know if I want you to see
Then this isn't the end

[Verse 1]
I'm a sinner in my own world
With nothing to show
I try my best just to feel
The weight of my own world
Can't control the things I am taught by no one
And can't really explain
What's inside me that'll make you feel worthless so
Can you break out into something different?
So don't be afraid of the darkness

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(You wanna feel bad for yourself?)
Say there is a way to heal (let us know when we say it...)
All my brothers and sisters are blessed with their life...
Everyone can live their happy life (and never question it...)

[Chorus]
When it all comes down let me stay right here
It will be enough if we do this shit for ourselves (because we got to do it!)
(If we don't) We're living the future
Don't have to worry about what tomorrow brings (it will happen anyway)
No matter what happens, we gonna survive
Life is real so everybody's free from fear and suffering
We gotta get back together (and don't forget to love those who have gone before)
Cause if they keep doing stupid things (they can kill somebody) they won't see another day
There could be changes coming someday
[Post-Chorus]
When it all comes down, yeah, it's gonna be enough for us (cause we got to do it!)
Everybody has the power to change up society (but we gotta live our lives and learn our lessons!)

[Refrain]
We might not like what that is
But i believe everybody should die peacefully (cause we've got everything to run towards!)
Oh yeah!

[Verse 2]
We only speak through broken eyes
As someone standing proud against myself
'Cause I'm ashamed of how I treat people
Just because I exist does not mean we're equal (even though we can compare)
Like every other person I've ever known that would have said 'oh' once in time
[?]
Well if we can agree on anything we gotta talk honestly, honestly
Why should I even bother to listen to shit that my fellow man has taught me
I was born to stand up in defense of my brothers and sisters
They've been held accountable for killing a hundred people (for raping them, murder them, murdering them)
A hundred murders a week, but if you follow the path I take you'll have your freedom
You better be thankful for the blessings you'll reap (for being a father too)
'Cause every single little thing that makes a nation great somehow, I know
We need to rise above, cause we already are rising above

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You think there's more to life than a little girl asking "why did she come?"
'Cause every little girl always gets what she deserves most
I know your heart isn't the only heart in the world
Everybody knows that when it fails - your head starts spinning, well
Please say one thing that ain't true: there will always be hope in life
No matter what happens over the course of an issue, it'll be alright
The only way of changing our hearts is to say its goodbye
[Chorus]
When it all comes down lets go back home
Let us breathe in at night again
One second feels good when everything fits into place
But then I realize where I started in my life
I changed now that I'm feeling much better
Now I finally start to live fully

When it all comes down lets go back up
Let us breathe in at night again

Yeah, we may not like what that is, but i believe everyone should die peacefully (cause we've got everything to run towards!)
Oh yeah!

A new start to the story of a young boy named Alex
But he's never had a friend before, and his past never seems to be
His family don't really want him back
There's even some confusion 'til they see another day
When Alex hears the sounds of blood running down those streets
And the silence surrounding their broken home
It makes him wanna go away but just sits there for awhile now
As Alex stands there in tears as he fights with his grief and how he would live
To live a life like these everyday
And all he’s left is scars that linger in his mind somehow
And it reminds him who he was while he was gone
When Alex comes across you

Pushing on through your window when you need a help
But everything you do or say can turn into a fight
And if you lose somebody and it's hard to stay strong
Come try so you know what can happen
Even though you're trying so hard to fight off those bad feelings inside again


Chorus:
Baby keep your head up, watch this world burn. (light burning)
Tell me something different, just don't let your emotions bleed (life changing)
Let my heart go dry without trying too much
All I will do is trust you... Keep your head up.. Watch this world burn. (burn)

Verse 2:
He says he's sorry, but everyone thinks he's perfect
The kids that he knows are always so hard to find
Some are so distant, some are gone by far
Though still very proud of them
One of they's said well there isn't any one else
But Alex's lost himself somewhere between being lonely and alone
They ask him why he lost his friends he once loved, now he finds him missing

[Verse 1]
Tell me if you're there, to pick your nose up in this town and show us what you see in it just from outside, even the walls behind your house keep turning gray, but it's clear that all of the doors are closed, not the ones in any one single room, I ain't seen much but I can dream about it as a child, let 'em know that you here with love and that you never felt alone, while they look at you and wonder where you go so you won't need to fight the fear, and I know you were born into a world that was meant for no other way except suicide. That shit was real and I will never forget because I was so scared of things, but I'm sure that i've seen people lose you inside yourself before

This verse goes out to all the lovers of “We Love Music”. Our hearts are filled with love and that's why we play along because if I were your lover, we'd break the rules right? Maybe then, maybe someday we'll see you cry one more time. You want someone else like me too but now you've taken on another role?

Verse 2:
It's not a question you have to ask. It takes only what's true. Nothin' you hear or see and nothing will make em cry. You gotta understand about the passion in this life that you bring just the same way as when you move around, just the same way

Chorus:
And I know how this felt back in our youth
Before the day we left the womb, so it feels like home
Even tho we're different it was meant for each other (oh)
Tear down those walls forever, no matter what they say... (treats us with kindness)
But tonight I'ma burn through my world, just to feel the music again

Don’t you let down the ones and only one of us get to win (Win, win)
If your love is a battlefield, I will make it right for you (Make it right, yeah)
I wanna be just like you
Bein' something good together
Don’t you let it go (Go without no more)
So when we fall in love
Then we won't get caught up in our own shit
It's not about how much love we have
The way that you take the time that it takes
And tell me what's so exciting?
This feeling of mine
Can we keep this dream together forever? (That's true)

[Verse 1: Yung Waka Ace]
No matter if we break out fighting or fight back
My heart stays open all the while you try to make me angry
When don't feel like you need my heart anymore
But you never come around cause your own pride ain’t worth my time
You gotta say it to yourself when you really understand me
All the things that I mean to you would be alright if you could believe me, yeah! Yeah
[Hook: Yung Waka Ace + Instrumental Break]
Don’t you let down the ones and only one of us get to win (Get to win)

Verse 1 (Spoken):
So I'm wondering where do we begin?
How does it feel being broke?
It's like having fun, I remember when it felt like my father had just died
With his wife and kids in his arms, I remember every single day
That night he pulled me out of that house and took me to a party that went terribly wrong
We tried talking but lost our minds and ended up both in a dark corner of the park
When you wake up late the next morning there was nothing to do at all
And then I remember my last call to my Mama that night
I guess I got enough that she wasn't going into her way
And so she played the part of the hero and found another girl. It almost never happened though

Why we should worry, just let 'em find out why they hate
Can't let 'em hurt us cause they wouldn't even know what could we learn

It's like a day and time 'cause no matter what you're doing
No one could ever replace you
If you lose my love that same night then the next time I fall apart girl it's your last chance
This song really makes me wanna go outside in all the cool shit
The only other person who truly understands my emotions is the fucking singer, you know I hate him
Glad people heard me lately, my fans still listen to the music man
I guess this year will be a test but now we up at 4AM (2AM) when the lights out on the club
You know that vibe when you talk to everyone and everybody knows that you are mine
I used to be an artist before music dropped but shit, right now I feel like I'm out here just trying not to feel this cold and alone anymore
Now I gotta find someone new and I’m searching for someone real with my heart and soul
When I get back, my love might have changed the way that I think and I don't know exactly how, what happened to the times that I felt like I was the man? Nowadays when we fall apart sometimes I still fall in love or maybe I just can't see my dream coming true I guess it depends but I wish it did (Yeah)
My exes told me "Just call my lawyer" every time something happen to you
But now I've got a girl I can finally say goodbye

Asking you for an epiphany
To let me know that life sucks like cancer
But I'm here already so baby lets pretend you're mine
If they said love could never heal, who'd give a fuck?
What else would these fake friends be missing out on?
They didn't wanna get it when you made yourself seem like a fool again
Lookin too much in front of them and couldn't decide which one is who got 'em
Is he what they think or is he just misunderstood? If he really isn't trying then it ain't no lie
So why bother even try?
Yeah your life fucked me up and they thought it was better after
Tryna help you and hope you understand where we went wrong
But you keep lying but you still look good in the mirror
And your eyes are always wide open hoping maybe not at all

Dreams keep flyin', livin' in the moment I'ma die
Movin' like never before (Yea), yeah! (Yeah)
All my life it was all the same
Everything has changed for me and the people that love me
So why we tryna be what you want? That shit is so confusing
And I'm just tryna make sure everybody's happy
But everyone's gonna leave me behind
No one wants to stand at a intersection anymore
No-one wants to fight this discrimination
I can't let nobody tell me everything about myself
I ain't got any plans anyway to hide this negative baggage
I'm going through hell and back with no regrets at all
The world only sees bad things when their positive energy gets depleted
Everyone seems to hate on us but every time we fall (fall!)
We fall from grace by our own hands (hands)
They never ever want us to hold the line 'cause now it's clear that it's not fair (right) (ayy)
I guess i had some ideas of who i wanted
A lot of people wanna do us harm for that, fuck 'em, get rich off of weed like v.o
And that's funny though because that ain't the whole point of being free
For real, living for dreams always has to have meaning to me


Versus
Ima be there like I used to be and it be cool when it sounds mean
To feel better than when I was here with my friends
Or when I was working hard under these hard times
I will never ever let them stop me, until they realize that I'm alive (yeah)
And I know it makes my heart hurt the way sometimes
Sometimes I wish I could be more like you, but this would've been too easy
There's such a beautiful side to life that I cannot hide, cause I believe
My dreams are true, even if I live too long
Just for being human, I just need someone to listen
Someone with a heart so strong that it can carry me far
(Trees in the desert, clouds in the sky)
All I hear are voices saying something inside my head
Wish that I could take it as a sign (sign) – no use telling, say bye

Trying, takin me through the storm as though I'd always been there alone

My momma taught me that loving doesn't mean nothing cause when that part is broken sometimes it's hard enough to heal

And her time is money short, but she said "I'm on my way up so I'll be right here by my side..."
Said he'd come around once a month but girl your timing in knots
The only time she really seemed bothered was when she felt her neck twanging
So she walked down where I've been, found solace through words
Where you used to be my mama, when I left them bruises
But she says she loves us now more than the life that we live

Love or trust one another and just have fun together(never fuck with another girl, even that shit ain't true)
And all you get is fame and attention for having the guts
Cause love makes you crazy, cause love makes you scared
When you meet new people they just do better than before
Just being together makes you sad for everybody out here
It takes some time but always knowing you are worthy of these blessings
God help us though!
Chorus:
Rise up out of this world (oh) In my hand I'm so high
Feel what you would do if told me i could see
Anything that happens around you i want and need you back
(and baby don't cry, baby you were still alive & everything is okay) Baby don't cry, darling you were still alive and everything is okay
Baby tell me how you feel..
Them days gone, i've been dreaming, trying again
Dreams gonna get better
Than ever since im born baby say I'm blessed
So I guess Imma take care of ya when things don't change
So if ya thinking boy i'll promise ya you'll make it
Cause baby believe me, i told you i wouldn't let you down
Oh oh...

Verse 2:
Feels like the past really has moved on
Been so long looking back and i remember you were mine
No regrets bout our past ,we did something special to each other for a reason
And hope we all make it out alive and i bet it doesn't stop
Baby stay right next to me and baby dont fight
Girl whats going on ? i'm loving you, please give me hope you can come home

If you never write a song 'cause of someone else's mistakes
Then I think of how much trouble we could've made if anyone was trying to put you
In my shoes by pretending that it would take effort and help me get out.I'm scared of trying, because nobody gives advice with no understanding of what they preach to, so I know I gotta stand up next’s gotta be something serious ‘bout all of when they’ll see a sign that makes no difference
This is for the people whose confidence got a knock-kneed in their stride,’ cause I see no way out if we keep on pushing forward or hold back
We push our hearts into the ground and move like stones, and then finally we feel it begin to sink deep inside again. This world it keeps running down my spine. And I can't get out alive either

I'm so confused about where my future's at
Is there something wrong here anymore?
Just remember to hold out a hand for me
And if things fall through then one day you'll see

So I will fight all my feelings
So as long as I live that's okay...oh yes!

'Cause I don't believe in miracles, cause nothing happened overnight
But this one good thing has helped me realize
Everything can begin soon...you have it!

Oh yeah, I really gotta show you now

I guess I only saw you once inside of my mind
And I thought before I said it, maybe next time I might say it
But somehow I failed the test
There's not enough trust left behind to stay alive
You can take your chance girl
At least say that you're fine tonight
Cause even if there's a broken heartbreak still
Sometimes it kills you to look and cry
Take your chances baby
Life's a bitch 'cause there's no one to blame
And when you run into trouble
Don't try to escape with my sidekick
I hope she don't bite her lip
She knows that I'm stronger than i ever seem

Everything that happens between us all gets different each time we grow older
When I'm in the ground it's hard to hide 'cause you're always at my front door
I'm scared of heights but sometimes baby I'm looking down on you
It's just one thing I know I love you so let me share this dream

[Verse 1] 2 times as good was my childhood memories
And when I woke up I knew that I could use an education
But living with my dad didn't feel right
My dad wanted me to leave the house before he started acting jealous
Now my life seems bleak, my friends are saying I got too much baggage
If I had money I would pick it up and move on
I keep thinking about how to live in that world without feeling stuck somewhere far away
That's why I've traveled the world searching for what might give me hope
Hope is a drug that helps the most in life
Because in life we have to sacrifice the worst part to be a good kid again
That's why everything that happens between us all gets different each time
You make sure you eat your own weight, when you take a loss
Then some things will come along, you'll realize there's no turning back
A little bit better tomorrow means better luck next year

First: My love is real - yeah I'm real
My faith is real - it's on my life and it's all that matters
No need to be insecure or insecure of what God has placed in me
My faith is real, I believe if you've got your mission within and I've set myself free now then come back in peace (yo baby)
(Y'all know we did it), yo oh yeah right baby and let's do that (yah-hey)

Song: Ooo o oo
Gotta get away - let it go, let's go for it
Never give up on the dream that you got, ain't no way - no way


Second: In my heart just like Jesus never went away
He came in me where sin was at its root
He kept me in His thoughts that He can help me through
Just to see the world brighter
Than it was before He walked out the door
I feel so blessed, so grateful, and in love with God I am
God blessed as I live everyday, praying to Him every day
I love and honor Him for who He ever was
So how I thank Him even though my soul is gone baby
How I thank Him when his heart breaks when His words don't mean nothing about Him still
That's why I thank Thee I have to shout that I'm praying to God whenever I feel like I gotta drop some
All these things are needed by God and this hope that He brought will make a difference in me
When I see the strength that's what helps me in any situation that may not necessarily be good for me
And He'll bless my soul with all Lord knows that
As long as I'm here God always loving me but He keeps on giving my spirit back
Yeah
Now!

Third: And I pray my love - y'all sing my Heart beat when I touch the sky...and I say, "Y'all the best!"
Ooo o o o o o o oo
Gotta get away, let it go, let's go for it ...ohhh baby..
For God

Verse 1: [Samples from solo]
Oh lord....
I been crying and fighting through hell, hoping that somebody told me maybe I should repent....
But that's okay, just know that there’s always something more
Right now, I'm feeling low and losing balance trying to figure it out and I’m tryna figure it out (yeah)
So many times I been falling down
I can't even move, my feet they shaking and holding on tight
Cause everything that people telling me isn’t really true
You gotta start talking 'bout what you're living for and what you're worth....
We gotta pay our way back to the roots, yes we gotta go up in the clouds

(To be continued)
My lyrics are for the youth who ain't had to have no problems at all
It's a hustle!

If you're down to ride it or do without (You can do anything if you go all out), that's right baby, whatever you want (and I don't know what I'm going through)
But when it's time to live your life, give it another try; you're just one of many guys with good intentions

You've got it all figured out in your head though - take the time to read between the lines. You'll learn 'til you make it and now - even at the most small stages! Yeah, come back home, everybody listen to yours alone
Be real with yourself - maybe you'll succeed, that's why we always look into your eyes

And we wanna know if you're gonna live and dream it all through, right? What will you be doing if you find you wanna be something more than what you need to be?
The fact is they already know
-
[Hook]
And all you gotta do...be ready to get down....when the sun goes down, man...
One last drink, bring the liquor back...come back home...the boys are ready...

So start now and let's begin
There's nothing I won't teach, none I won't share, my love is with me
Cause you got to know it's been two weeks since there's been nobody else around, oh how long have you waited? (Oh, it's been two weeks)
'Cause everyone wants the same thing and each has their own opinion on it and every choice that was made for them - every single word they say is true
Every heart that waits feels special, every heart that cries is stronger
Even though everybody seems to think their way inside this big world, yeah our lives are different because people are scared of change and they don't know how to show they're living their dreams
So come on..

I got a lot of thoughts right now cause these were written down by my mom at three.  So like I said when you read it out you know it really wasn't meant for every single one that's in the home or in the city so if ya gotta decide make sure I’m not about all the people that we had.  But since we ain’t talking ‘cross-class and all that, even through this heartbreak it still can’t be erased.   If love could only find its way back to somewhere else we would see our life get better! And I remember looking up that’s where most of the lights go down.  We started off here on our own, now we getting closer to being the ones who have to put their bodies out here instead of just going to go and pick some flowers up from their yard!  And after we finish making ourselves better, we will finally meet and have some fun with each other again... and then someday....we will reunite and we will have some fun together. Yea

Look at me burning in the light
The sun on your head so tired of waiting no one around will hear that I'm standing by my bed every second now oh it's sad to see
You just don't want a friend. You can't even love a wife. It looks like your only option

All I got for today is I'll give in without looking up
If there wasn't change that'd be so fine

[Verse 1]
She likes her hair curly, smooth and clean
She like what comes to mind (Come get with me)
She can take no good from this one
All we need is a friend to guide us through the storm
We can learn to care for each other in the darkest night
The devil will take you by the hand
And let your faith come into focus when she gets down
I told myself I want some better things to make you proud of yourself
When she starts to walk away but it don't matter at all
No one knows about our condition if they don't ever tell you something
I'm trying not to be afraid at first

[Chorus]
As I open up the door 'til that girl finally breaksin' out again
And tells me how many times should we wait?
So long, babe, so long
But we're gonna keep it under lock and key till the fall

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you see it?
That's right, babe (oh, no way)
Every second count keeps you here
I'm trying, I'm crying
I'm waiting now because I'm going far
You never thought that time would change when you were still around
Oh well, then tonight, oh well, now
Will I get you next time?
[Interlude]
Yeah, babe

(Oh well, then tonight)
Ooohh, ooooh, ow

Lately it feels like lately ain't anyone got shit up to
Do you know who made your decision? Who does he love too...?
Baby don't stop tryna feel your name play along
[Bridge]
Love goes back and forth like it would never end anyway
Crying for some reason but loving someone who isn't real even though
It drives you crazy
And makes your heart break everyday
But sometimes I think
Is there even something I could do that would change your mind? Yes!

[Chorus]
So close, yeah
Keep it close, yeah
Close, uh, close
Just put your arms around me 'fore I see ya light
So close, oh-oh
Close, babe

Verse 1:
Every time I make something, it's just cause i got nothing
So when your ex asked why that boy kept on taking pics to Instagram
You told me what he did was so lame they never even looked at him
But girl how could I ever let that go
I'm sorry but that wouldn't happen if we didn't hit it like that
But my life just ain't one where I can't put shit under the sun
Why would I do this again with nothing left?
If everything we've ever had is just a flashback, I should stop thinking about our lives
And get to writing lyrics, then all that shit will be better with time

Chorus:
Life's a dream 'til I drop this crown, but if the world's empty, and you're gone, let us have a piece of mind

Hate yourself? Maybe it's your depression that drives you crazy

Pull up with his girlfriend to get her outta my sight
Won’t see me tonight cause that boy got a hold of my heart
Like a car chase. I cannot keep an open road
Hooked up and then I got locked up
Comes back around to let my emotions take it's course

But you made some good friends? No i never been here

Then she started taking drugs while smoking crack
And then she started getting high off marijuana - smoked a few milligrams of that shit

So start up a match
Try and stop it with your arms
With every beat till the start
Starting to feel some joy
With each word and then you forget who I love
Now here i am
No one ever seems to know my name
But we started off as something pretty
Then people stopped us thinking about everything we said
But now i got this feeling
If only they knew what happened for me
That day was such an amazing day
Dreaming how could i possibly be sad at all?
I remember vividly how happy i was with everything today
I should have asked my father about it, he couldn't relate
He tried to tell me 'don't stress that shit no more'
But nothing can change what you already know 'cause you never lose 'em
So why do i wanna see you cry when not even breathing?
I don’t really care if the world ain’t getting better or worse!
Yeah.  Every time i think about this, though
Everyone around gives out their hopes (hope) (hope) But i still gotta live life hoping someday i will win 'cause
Every day it gets harder
Sometimes life is harder , sometimes life sucks


Genre: Rock
Gonna run through in these tracks
The road where you can find everyone so you can race everywhere
Sending all your energy trying to find someone great and to be honest
It's been hard before but this time i'm really feeling good.  A lot has changed
They say there is just pain and heartache because everybody wants to chase goals but they don't do it all on purpose- and therefore its not easy.  The key to this is doing everyday and all that you get is motivation
And I promise

Chasing dreams, running faster than the wind
(1st verse)
And if we don't follow
We can run away and fall all alone
But I'm hoping
You'll know just what they got to say
(2nd verse)
I've been dreaming of this whole time
I never thought these words could come true
I've been wanting this for long no end
Dreams are so real
Wisdom is such a virtue
I can feel it in my bones
It's like a fucking song to me
Like when you take your first breath
And start singing again now
No one really does that
I'm still here but someone else would notice that
A dream is a state of mind
A state will always lead to better things
Cause you're just chasing dreams
So why am I trying to stay?
Just keep running down in the dirt
When someone else can't even stand a chance at you
(3rd verse)
Hey, hey babygirl listen carefully
You shouldn't have wasted another second on your own
And I don't think it's fair
This way you hurt right
So please step out and get some rest
To prepare yourself for what to do next
The best option isn't an option anymore
'Cause you need more peace of mind
Than ever being sad
Instead of living inside your demons
You should learn every step along the road
For instance, do not kill yourself or your family
As a matter of fact, don't waste too much time thinking about it

You're far from perfect but you're far from perfect because of your mindset
When people are scared of change, they're afraid to be scared of change 'cause they know who they are
Because their brains don't contain enough energy
They're afraid to show you a smile
In the face of adversity
They're afraid to realize that nothing you say will change
Or will make you any stronger
Your brain is made up of broken pieces
Where the pieces belong, there lies a hole for you to fill

VERSE 1:
They say there's a magic in your eye but it's so hard to see where it's all meant to be because of the way that you're looking at me or how everything feels when your lips kiss my fingertips
You got to find a path that's made for real
You can make it through the night if you wanna
There's only one option - no one's stopping us now. Don't get caught up in their ways and I'm going insane with it cause they aren't aware of what I've done in my life

PRE-Chorus:
You can be everything from an ordinary human being into someone full like a giant spider in a movie
Don't even try. It'll never work 'cause it won't last forever
I’m not afraid of anyone who tries to stop me, until all they know is that I'm gonna have to fight for them cause I want to run...
It’s always the same thing like I keep on fighting just trying somehow and everytime that I go it comes back to making love again
So it happens again like I'm moving forward all over again

Chorus:
So I don't care anymore if we just keep on growing like seeds inside my own mind
Cause there's going to be more years waiting for you to catch a glimpse into my soul. Let me take you deep down inside

VERSE 2:
But I'll tell you why - you know exactly what's happening now and as I let you stay till I finally breathe (it's the second time ever that you told me)
We could talk about anything you love or whatever you hate to
But I believe in this moment for you too much to handle but first let yourself go
Get it together, don't push it away
Your love and mine will fall apart if you don’t take what you need from me

PRE-Chorus:
You can be everything from an ordinary human being into something complete like a huge spider in a movie
When you know you’re gonna have to fight for everyone to know your worth
If ever there are mistakes there's not any harm you can do to yourself
If you lose what you have you'll only survive once you make it far. It's alright, you can carry on with the things that you started right

So get ready for this new song ‘cause it’s about a time now
But if you wait for the moment to pass then I might give ya my heart right here before we finish it
Let’s talk about that time with us and we don't have to be friends (yeah)
And let's take another road trip like last year
What a long way down
I guess I can't say much since there was nobody else around
No one has ever asked me to help, how did they think of the time when this all became possible?
Not me, no one can relate what you're asking about us
You always had something to say while we were waiting (yeah)
And everything is okay just tell me which ones will hold you tight 'cause it won't never change but who will care?

(Verse 1)
My baby came home with my best friend and she wanted to do him some favors
She asked me would I ever let her in anyway if she didn't know the price?
It was like a daydreaming, got a cold sweatshirt on so I didn't see her smile
Told her come over and hug me, made out kiss on her lips, told her I'm yours too
And she didn’t seem sad at all when I started to get to know her
When it was time to say goodbye, I said girl go with your heart and mind
And she said listen carefully when I called
We should both hear myself crying out
Please don't put yourself in my place so I can make amends

(Verse 2)
The night before I saw her smile went by so hard I gave up trying again
Now everyday was getting harder and harder as I kept looking at the things she wanted me to do
I almost said that everytime I thought about coming home I'd run out of my mind
'Cause these other guys never cared when you didn't know the price
How could I let my family down when I wasn't sure how it would feel?
Forget your feelings maybe I'll be the one to give their daughters away

I hear you in my dreams
Like a dream come true through this lonely road
When I close my eyes there is something that I see
The light of your love
Let me know someday we'll find new meaning
Let's walk on forever together
Come for real, we will be one

[Verse 2]
As I walk across time, I am like the sun at night
All alone, but I'm trying so hard to hide
You tell me not to worry
No matter where I'm going on
My arms are around you tonight...
[Bridge]
Just before the fall
What was once my home
Now it seems too far away
Ohhhhh...
I can't cry and breathe
I just need someone to hold me when I'm crying
But as the stars dance

When I think about those nights...
What were them?
Our life became nothing
Never had any choice
So now everything fades

Even though I really don't even care much anymore
Don't think about it for you anyway. I'm sorry for giving up and doing anything for something that I love. Yeah! Now that we've grown up
We got better things to do, but I hope the things you did make it more worthwhile
Everything was good together between us, until some things have changed in life

But now things are falling in love not love or feelings is what you want them to be

I’m waiting here for a moment of clarity and you’re not ready. All that was inside the first place is now at the bottom—now everything has become all right and everything changes in me as nothing’s left to break into. You don’t need to let it slip away. And when things all go wrong before too long, then there were better days and worse days with me instead of you. You know what happened next. I wanted it to be over… no. It didn’t mean any harm. I never would've done anything else to make you feel so proud about yourself and your family. It helped me realize just who I am. I never wanted anyone else to end up like you. My heart beat at night, but your pain is still there."

Why I'll keep this all for the rest of your life
Maybe time will tell
Well let's just have fun, okay (yeah)

Verse:
Tell me who my friend and what do you love
Tell me where did we begin
If you could save someone else from falling in love with another guy
But girl I never wanna see them cry again
All these girls are crying because they need help
And that ain't cool
When is the last time you showed up at my place?
Are you feeling sad about everything and all ya do now ?
Is there ever hope to live on another man's line ?
It isn't clear
Just when i see myself as a human soul trying to be somebody
Then you become my only one
I've always had feelings for you and you go hand in hand
It's getting harder every day sometimes cause you just can't feel no more
But maybe time will show

Can’t believe that you're just out on bail
My dreams never got off the ground but it’s what it's been
I wanna change my ways, we can see this shit from a different angle
They keep on coming back to tryna destroy everything in the game
I don't really want those niggas they're doing me wrong every time
And like all your friends they get you fired up while you still trying to fit in
But now I've caught up with a new generation and so the pressure seems justified
The hype has faded, no more rumors being spread as they leave behind their past

You tried to fuck around, left me traumatized
Been focused on myself since day one. (Walking)
Now there lies the problem of success to blame
In between, these niggas they won’t even listen cause they don't know how the truth works
[?]  That ain’t where I stay at, you think its because you were broke
I'm just hoping you understand some niggas is stuck here waiting for something real to rain
They tryna make you cry, they tried to convince you to quit your job then they go to bed
No one knows if people come up, when you finally feel that they do too
Then you'll start to question if the struggle is worth making. , Yeah you will get better everyday

What a mess there used to be
Now they don't wanna talk no more
All these drugs are poison all they ever known was just an alibi
That ain't even what they say
I know now that's real
And every second counts like that shit is right
With so much bullshit going on in my head and now I'm feeling like my life been taken over by fear
(yeah I see those) Yeah this time I really hate myself but why would I leave
It's getting bad sometimes
Cause these thoughts inside of me got me thinking some crazy shit
Yeah i swear that's who he let us go with cause there's so much in my body

We never really believed what we said

No it wasn't always easy or fair cause everything was going great
People around me didn't get what we wanted
I remember back when i was walking round this fuckin road
Thinking bout who that man was after
And this shit changed somehow
Can't believe i survived it without him

But still the pain is here all over my family
So i'll keep screaming till we die alive

Verse 1:
All I ever wanted would be a place where you wouldn't feel alone
But now you're out here all alone
So hold me tight, my darling don't worry too much
I know it won't be long until we can finally make something clear
You got me going crazy because of who is always there with a smile on their face
(?) just for you and us
Cuz when the dark days are over, oh yeah, I won’t be back again!

Come on now we gotta find our way home (come on)
I'm sorry about some words that I didn’t mean it, yeah

Everything gonna be alright tonight
Wondering just what will you spend your final five minutes dreaming

In my head I would still be with you but today... It doesn't seem fair
Tell me why... why could i go through this
Would it ever end or how did i survive it?
It's hard for me to ask yourself
Why am I still asking myself though ???!
Why does it even matter to myself
If i wanna die tryna change my life somehow
Am i only being selfish if i don't give it enough
Are I really meant to be honest? Then maybe this all means nothing at all
But look here now my baby, it makes sense
The things you gave are not what they used to be
How could I be so ashamed of having loved you when all that you had left for me ain't worth it????????

Pre-Chorus 2
Girl, tell me now what do you know?
Got me going wild
Can you explain how i turned around?? Yeah, let me show you
A brand new love without any doubt
No, please come see me everyday
Just tell me who you see next week

Chorus:
I don't care about tomorrow
'Cos my love has already gone
There's a reason why i'm still lonely
Every night i miss you 'cos i swear
Don't ever forget this world is mine
I'm dying every night
Please make me happy tonight!!

I don’t wanna let it down. This shit has never been this bad before. All of my life we have had all kinds of trouble with words. But now i’m just not the one that needs to know what i’m supposed to say.  I’m trying to reach out for something but its just a little bit dark and hard.. And thats why its kinda hard when i get home every night. It's like i’m trapped in a cage no i ain't even found a way out but i still hope that i’ll someday find peace...and maybe someday.
You can ask my sister if she does need me there is only another person that would show me how to cope with this world without this pain.. If anyone wants to talk about her please let her talk about her, because i could go on and teach someone alot about love & depression.. If she doesn’t want to talk about me she can always text him. There are 2 sides of the same coin, one side can help us understand the truth while the other side takes us back for years, as they were standing behind us trying to see the whole picture with each others eyes. My sister and mike always keep telling me that i’m all the same

It came with the game but now it's all the same
Crawling back down, falling through the pit

When our love was still so strong

For me to make it into my dreams
Baby don't let nobody judge you, when you live and breathe and believe
Let's go and do it somehow no matter if it ain't yours or mine if you hate yourself or whatever

Pre-Chorus 2:

How do we grow up after we learn these rules?
Even when you got hurt, you wouldn't want another guy to fix you
So many scars left behind but I don't feel sorry for myself anymore 'cause I don't know how to cope
So much shit inside, always feeling like there's always someone behind me

Chorus:
If all hell was breaking loose
I'd rather be safe with you instead of running away
You made everything so impossible
So what did you think then you went and turned innocent?
When life turned cruel, I really didn't know who I am anymore
So how are we supposed to be together?
What do we say and do we carry more weight in our lives today?
The answer we never have, has nothing to do with us anyway

It's your love that made us fall this way, baby...

Verse:
Everybody knows that there is time
To change this world and make some sense of the things that they're doin.'s the only reason it's so easy...
Why?
Everybody does a lot on their own, and then it feels like they're doing no one else in fact... What's the point of a person if they're just alone? It makes it harder to see the bigger picture. People get lost once in a while sometimes, when they start to realise what they should be. But maybe that would be alright because you'll find people better, they'll learn, they'll understand… but I feel there will ever be someone who can guide you on your way back, who knows anything about the way life go or what happened last night. So let me be clear - all my life I been on a roll and I know it's not fun, I just wanna help everybody out… You gotta treat yourself right. You gotta say a prayer... You gotta get strong before anything else gets you hurt. And don't take anything from anyone except God himself though, especially your sister.. He taught us how to love and live a good life

Preach:
Chorus:
This is where I lay my heart
When all of the world is looking me in the eyes
But this ain't no hard road... To heaven or hell
Yeah

{Bridge:
And then again
There will never be someone who can guide you after all... (Oh-oh-ohh, oh god!)

Verse 2:
There will always be somebody with something to say. Someone with good morals, someone who gives everyone hope of getting ahead but also wants to save others from themselves and maybe you can give them that advice too! So just remember... Every life has different elements. Life is more or less chaotic, there may be no salvation through every circumstance of life. This is just to prove my point! Every man is given a chance, he must take on a responsibility. And nobody can change how he reacts to adversity and what it hurts when he suffers. So you have to remember... I walk with purpose and my life is full enough for me… But sometimes, that means that life will bring you down. So just believe in Yourself

[Verse 1: M.E.S.]

Well we both know every time one of us has a problem
There's nothing left to say if she's not feeling her feelings
It could be that love was just begun and we didn't have much fun
'Cause we came through for the thrill, but now we get burned and hurtful
And don't wanna ask her out or tell her friends
If she ain't really into us we might just leave again
We had a rough start, we finally blew up on each other
She took this pain, made it a better love than anyone should
I felt like I was the only one who cared
But how could we even change? And why am I still a friend at night?
How could we make this work anyway?
Can we do things like make love again or make it wrong?
Or can we learn from what we did let it pass?

Chorus:
Oh oh oh oh
Won't you sing me a song of your glory? Cause I don't want to die anymore
Sing me a song of our glory
When I get up I need an angel beside me singing all alone
When it's time to fly, just make sure that I'm flying by me with two wings as my flight path goes along
In this life every child comes a little closer, so don't be afraid because it's not no secret
This will last forever until the day we reach the sky

Verse 1:
I said that I would make love again
I know I should make you happy
But who is that baby and when are you gonna leave him? Now he starts crying
The sun is setting and then the clouds cover us both as if nothing happened
Let's go to some beach in California
Maybe I'll get some water before I start to run

Pre-Chorus:
But you didn't really go far from what happens when they say you're gone
So I'm looking for an old dream that won't change
I've got a place on the sand where wind blows and raindrops fall in
There's only one way out and that is always with you there by my side

Verse 2:
Now I'm singing along at the beach where I can feel something more alive
Than anything ever had before
But this isn't a dream I can't share with anybody
Cause everyone that knows about me lives in my dreams
That's why everybody has their own view of my mind
And i wanted to give you a real kiss like you never even talked about kissing before
And now you have somebody new to kiss with and now I'm ready to do whatever they think

Pre-Chorus:
But you didn't really go far from what happens when they say you're gone

Verse 3:
Well hello, I've read you on twitter, thought I forgot what you meant
Now the last lines are coming back with so much punchlines
Yeah you're great, I guess that ain't the best I could do. But girl, let me thank you for sharing these words with me
Baby girl, if the time comes to give you a heart that isn't in ashes but still holds true

How are these things really coming apart?
What am I hoping will ever last ?

Verse 1:
I miss them all because of what they were
I know if they're all going away then why did it break my heart
So sad but please just love us and forget it is hard to feel right
Tell me you love me again cause you already know our fate is near

   Let's go back to when we was young and free
Maybe we'll never get together
We'd be fighting over money and things inside out
And that love got torn apart
In like a storm
It broke apart...
Ain't there something i need to tell myself ?
Something to show the world its okay to look back on its past
And wonder where it went wrong
I think about everything
How can I hold my own to this new life
I think about you too too

Aye, so let's leave this world spinning
I don't need no handouts
Im just a one off player
With no time for stress
That should have been my last call

That's what happens when a starless sky becomes too high
A higher star? (yeah)
Yes you had your chances to get out
And then people turned on you cause you left your friends
And you felt down and didn't say anything about the music that you're playing
Well all that really matters is what you show yourself
You got time for everything else that they hate
What makes them say you can do better than everybody else
But they won't stop it cause who are these fakes?
Hook:
Don't care what others think ya gonna do
They just know that they can see it through ya skin. They don't really care how you think ya gonna sound
Do you want to live in the light of a brighter night? You might lose my energy
Can't control myself, no, I'm not trying hard
In my own time and place, we might survive
The music is the only thing we feel alive. Everything has meaning...

Pre-Chorus: The lyrics to this track are entirely original
(The real stars!) Don’t judge them for what they say 'cos you can’t define what they mean
I can’t just pretend that I’m the greatest fan alive
If I put it in perspective all my own life I ain't got a choice
'Cos if we don’t live with each other then we never will be friends
Don't blame me not on myself or anyone else but myself
Because I'm so lost inside, losing all hope of finding an escape
But as the world starts to take its place over again
It feels like I've finally found who I am, no one could ever tell which of us’s the best
And here’s why:

Verse 1:
My vision takes a different color than mine in these photographs
Lookin' at the stars I feel much less alive
I think I wanna quit the music and just let up on the drugs

Verse 2:
Don’t judge me for all these mistakes I’ve made
You won’t get a chance to see the truth about me
Cause love is a constant drug, and that's really hard to find when everyone ends up deceased
So where do I begin? There’s nothing else left to prove until your soul is found

Verse 3:
I tried to get through the life before my parents died
I tried to make it to the top without ever even trying
But I couldn’t stop seeing every star that was going up in the sky
From being bigger than me now

Bridge: Every single chapter is a masterpiece! All the words I write were all dedicated with loving hearts

Inverse: I’m the reason that God did his very best
To set me straight in everything I did because He knew that I will make it
And all alone, I had the courage to open up my eyes and read my mind
Even though sometimes I try and hide my demons when I pray
But deep inside, I know something’s gonna be missing soon
I been trying to figure out how I got there, didn’t make it far and I still find inspiration every day
I can't go back, I cannot hide from God

I've been trying to come up from the depths of sin
What happened next? Where did Christ go?
All I can tell me is that Jesus is alive
I don't care if I die tomorrow, I can be saved someday

Cuz the things that you say to me always feel so fake (Feel so fake)
Like all these girls in my system will try and steal my money with your stupid shit
My main bitch on top of my dome , she really love it when I hop up out the dome

Pour shots on my ex, then we fuck 'round in this big moped truck
Them rappers would do it if they could, not here to impress us, who are these faggots?

I know what my dreams are like under this sky

There's also a dream and there's another person
That you're thinking of
In all these pictures

She only cares about her own self-indulgence
She never makes good on her own
She only sees herself because she wants others to be
She never knows when or why

Before Verse 1:
Let's rewind those moments when we were young and free
I'd sit behind your pillow
And hear the same voice in your head
But then as time passed by like a dream
I started feeling distant
And every one of us was holding hands in a blur
Now every day I feel like I'm falling apart from everyone
Because they both want something so special
You take a little chance, but sometimes you miss it
It doesn't really matter who dies, even if it's you

Verse 1:-
Everytime you go to visit someone new
You need some direction from their heart
So come and take care
Of everything 'cause it could help you grow
When you look into your reflection there's a shining light
That’s why I see this world in your eyes for everyday dreamers
There was always somewhere we used to go

Pre-Chorus: (2x)
The moment that you were born
We shared our life as one
A chance to be in each other's company
(To be together without no one else but you)
Let's just forget what we've been through...
Verse 2:-
Before they had ever seen us cry
The world couldn't wait
And you wouldn’t even think twice
But now you’re just in time enough to know
Everything 'round is meant to lead you where you are heading
Take control of all your plans then open up the door
Cause all your dreams will fall into perfect shape and form
Now with confidence here on Earth
It feels like home
In the eyes of the night
In the eyes of the night
I'm just saying baby give me the chance I need right now!

My story’s untold, but the fire still burns
I need you to read it. I know it's hard for me to see what’s true of who I am without you. I know that life is an epic, and just as many times it ended
You'll know, you'll know if you follow me, because I'm not afraid to be. And just as many times this pain has left me scarred
It's easy to forget it, but even more so, I won't lose myself in what's being put past me
So, yeah, let em' know my story, 'cause that's part of my life
As far as I know, all of y’all have been telling lies too long
And y’all don't listen, y'all think they're heroes, right? But why would that be the case? When they really ain’t giving a damn?

Verse 1:  It hurts me deep inside for everyone to see it was wrong from the start
Trying to escape the path I took for now, but every step it brings becomes a burden when you get close or learn it yourself first time around
Crying aloud at your sister's room when you finally find comfort with someone that you love doesn’t live there anymore
And there can't be any good things, no matter how hard they will always come. So, I must go off-the-dramatic like you did before. I'm falling deeper into shit you hate now or at least stay up late and stare it in the eye.

Sometimes in life, you have to ask yourself for help

How is heaven? I don’t understand, well it might seem hard just to believe me when i say the same thing and i break into tears. That’s why I couldn't give them hope, even if you’re not here now. It takes too long to see what i can’t. Your presence’s an open door. I hate having dreams, i wanna live again. Just imagine what life’s like without you around. My future feels like one long trip with no endinе. There’s no one, there’s nobody else, I wanna stay alive till day 1. We fight, fights inside our minds. If we live, we should live! Everytime we die, i swear i gotta run the marathon. When they let you go, my heart got broken. But I will try. I will try!!

When we broke up I knew everything would turn around (But honestly why would I change at all? Cause life is tough!)
You say that love equals failure then when you really fall down from your heights you get used to it baby you can put a little faith back in me as I let go for good cause I know I’ve been hurt by every single mistake that you’ve made man I hope you find peace in knowing that we could go forward with being together ohh yeah

So I guess that’s when we gon let go babe
Don’t be mad at me baby you already know whats on your mind uhh yeah its alright

Chorus:
Girl I know your name cause you look like me (Pretty much always do)
I come with a whole crew every day 'cause I come with a smile (Like okay you got to leave babe baby)
I just want her to love himself like a nigga do whenever he’s home alone
Baby boy I give a damn if you keep showing up at 3 o’clock
And I’m still on top so I'm not giving up on hope
You can take advantage though you really need that cash right now
But please don't be upset what your going through

I want to let you know that there's something about you today
That will make me feel happy and not mad

My father told me that you can always keep your soul together
But sometimes times I'm glad only if things aren't gonna be fine

Ladies and gentlemen watch you
If everything just changes from here on out
Will you even give up this life tonight
It isn't a game of chess or a life dance
I won't be playing if I think I'm wrong

They opened together oh what was new for me, oh
But she was still far away
To an end that I don't wanna be with anymore

The shadows disappear when this sun set sky
You may cry, but you’re all alone with me
I only see your eyes every time I’m close to you
And if you fall down and run away
Please don't call it selfishness. I don’t want no one else

Verse 1:
Don’t take blame on who you are 'cause what happened ain’t my fault
We got a lot of demons in our hearts that can’t let go of us
It feels like we've got a broken glass ceiling that has us spiraling out over infinity
Ain't there more than our fears?
I'm not an angel, but I'm part of everyone
No man should ever fail him or his way
When the angels call out their names just for a reason to believe they love him
He's lost a part of himself too much so he must pray to a greater being
This cannot be love
The shadow of the sun comes up and breaks up everything around it now

Chorus/Bridge:
Till then I keep waiting for someone to call me
Til then I’ll find another chance to sing
To lift the spirits above us once again

No one loves me like you
What better than him
He's really only around
Now he's feeling distant
This love has been hurt
I don't know why it hurts him
It won't help his feelings if he doesn't even tell God damn
He don't wanna hurt nobody
Why's that ?
Why dont you let Him know he loves you
And He will love you for who you are

When The Shine brights to me

Staring at these beautiful eyes
Embracing life in my arms
The faces they remind me of myself
I wanna hear

The echoes start from their very
Old
They don't have to die or make noise
To know one like me... it takes a bit of time and effort
But I want these shadows to live on

You're just a kid! I wanna grow up
And take my talents from you! (yep)
(Yeah Yee)

Chorus:
If I wanted nothing more than love, that would be what I wanted this night
So I took something real close with my eyes closed.. but if I had to go back inside and find
The truth about our relationship, so we could talk, how can you be
Not as blind as I'd like you to believe?
Cause I never felt what's most important
That's why all of those shadows got to shine.

Verse 1:

You give them your heart and mind
And they are forever strong
And everything is true

How do you see yourself when watching them move?
Or was it just a part of you?
If I could change where I went from here
I don't even know which direction I'm going
But I wanna try
Maybe someday it'll come 'round

In a world of pain
All my life has gone away
And now I feel the pain
In a place where no one will ever meet
My brother stood, his face fell down

If I wanted nothing more than love, that would be what I wanted this night
So I took something real close without my eyes closed
But if I had to go back inside and find
It really was my mistake
There ain't enough power within us  if we only looked inside
But sometimes darkness comes
Like raindrops fall like rain drops
On every tear I shed
So I started from my bottom

Yeah !

Chorus II :
If I dreamed... I wish it came true
And you're here to tell me how we'll live better
You'll wake me up with dreams of an all the stars above us
I wish it might come true and we could talk all day
So we can share the light and make this a new day


Verse 3:

So if we could show them through
Everything we've become
We could fly each other high above the stars
We would fly there singing together
In the sun right out this sky
I look in the mirror now - the colors
Of our colors shining through. All this love that you gave us
Just fills my heart

Maybe this will last forever, in the afternoon with him
Then maybe there will be someone that will love me back

That will take the pressure off my heart


In a world thats full of men and women who feel so insecure
A man can not change his way up to their full potential because people always be like that


And they still think that one day i would finally realize im not the same guy that i used to be


So far
Out of all those problems i feel the most in reality
But i just gotta let myself be strong until this whole situation just keeps going on


When this game goes into a tailspin when you are out of patience
Maybe we could finally get some help
Or maybe i could stay positive and be happy
Or maybe we can start building something real good instead of living

One day i'll see
All the things that i missed
But at the same time its too late cause I still need these feelings inside me

For Im feeling this right inside
Im thinking of heaven
While it burns in my dark eyes
Yeah

My actions were nothing to brag about

And I was out and about tryna see things my way (I be in that world where they don't treat you fair)
My money is on the map, but it's always the same (Always the same)
Why don’t you do the best things in your life?
You're always going to change (Oh...) when you know you got what it takes
But these days everything just feels all wrong
It drives me crazy. And why are we living this way
When you need somebody to come around sometimes for peace of mind
So if everybody can fixin' a broken heart get back together
And show us how to beat each other again
We gotta runnin', we gotta fight
Now let ‘em go, get em off like the rest with no regrets
Like I said before, we were born as one (so it seems)
We live our life with an agenda
And when we make it out the bottom floor, everyone has their share
You never learn to love it in your head or at least not until the door shuts in
Sometimes my mind just goes crazy too fast sometimes my body just wants something more
(?) Cause there ain’t nothing better than that feeling when someone else knows to put in work
How do we forget about that real time effort after overtime, hey yeah
All we really want from ourselves is just some more of these times (right now)
No worries cause here we are just getting started
What happens in this world when people look up at us instead of look behind us, yeah (ah no baby baby)
And they wonder why the world is falling into our hands? (oh oh ohhhh...)
Tell me now, have we done enough? Have we really learned enough?
Just listen and keep your eyes on the prize when the pressure gets too strong!

When your body aches, yeah I need it with everythin' of my might
I'm a human being, I ain't just a bitch
But girl this beat is really real, damn
This life feels beautiful as the last one left standing
Oh I feel alive (Yeah), alright (Okay)
Can you hear me out loud? Can you hear that melody?
Can you feel my spirit get higher? Can you read my voice?
Just for a moment (Yes for a moment!)
We were supposed to be together
But the past's changed us somehow now that it’s all done
I’m sick of hearing you shout your name back to me!

Verse 1:
I had no desire to be this way, so why would I ever give up?
My first love cheated on me and I had no one else but myself
All of my fears in my heart, they were making me weak
And oh how could I even understand it when its my only person
And now all that I can feel is loneliness. But I don’t care, she makes everything okay again

Chorus:
I hope you got some time with me
You're not alone because you need someone that you might have loved
But if we never meet each other, we'll grow apart
So keep your eyes open, I know you may not see
That's the only part of life for us to overcome
Cause what you have done will come back around forever

Verse 2:
Can’t get enough of that dream life
I just want to run away from it all
But what does it mean to make you stay?
Yeah!
In the morning everyone is smiling at me
Everyone wants me by their side, as long they can't think about
How he could have turned out so fine
Or should I blame him here, because I knew
When he said “I wouldn’t forget you'”
I couldn’t believe it

Chorus:
I hope you got some time with me
You're not alone because you need someone that you might have loved

Start:
As the song opens verse:
Took me to a place that was dark and lonely, but oh
It’s not my home
To where most people went wrong like in Iraq
I don’t think my family felt the same as yours do
When they went away, and you left them here
And it was bittersweet and bittersweet

Verses 1-2
First verse:
My heart felt a bit sad for being there when it lost all its light and its touch
But with You we were made at home inside of each other’s arms again
Second verse:
My heart felt sorrow because, on this first day, someone said to say:
Love will live on and on forever

Chorus:
You found peace within Your own heart, and you’ll see
That once you've made up Your heart, you can turn it around
And now that love is gone, you’ll still be with Me

Forgiveness: You’ll find yourself holding onto whatever hurts more than anything
What's your name? I wouldn't want to tell you names
Havoc: You’ll feel this pain all through our lives

Prod. by Jodeci at 7/21/95
Recorded in mono on a vinyl record in the mid-90s
The cover is a portrait of an Asian who never met her father
She was made to sing along with other singers so that her parents could pay her tuition
But until this, she had no formal education
From elementary from kindergarten till elementary school, she couldn’t even walk
The only time that she felt able to breathe is when she wrote along with the lyrics
Her voice sounded all over the place and everyone involved knew that
Although she tried to keep it real through the years but sometimes the silence got too much
At the age of 17, she was forced to change things up
Her mother had taught her how to stay calm inside and not speak her name before
She had no intention to make any changes because she didn’t feel like learning it
It took years but eventually she got into it
She was given a number in her family name so that they all could sign onto the record deal and get excited as we walked off
But one day she got older…she felt ready
She felt good again…but before long words came to describe her pain and discomfort
As one of the voices in her head said nothing – it was all a dream
Because her friends called and friends told her there would never be any joy out there for her
At least that’s what she had read on the cover
"I won’t be happy," she prayed in her mind; "I know life’s meant to be tough
We all try hard to live a better way but some lose their way."

Verse 1:
I’m just like anyone else, if it’s not for my own personal growth and that’s a fact
Everything was always me until now, you could say, oh so fast
All I need is patience to make my story stand out from the rest

The hardest times I had with all your love are starting to break the glass ceiling
They don’t feel there anymore, they don’t feel there anymore
You never knew how much I loved you, I know what it feels like to live in fear
You were so cold, I got so sick of this pressure that you felt in my eyes
Now it’s too late for that same thing again, but I can’t take it

Chorus:
Sometimes I wonder, can someone replace all these hurt feelings inside?
My hope is that someone will, help me heal this pain within

Can someone replace all these hurt feelings inside?
Can someone replace all these hurt feelings inside?
(No)

When I look into the future, is the one who chose to carry a burden?
(Yea)

When there’s something so wrong, the first person that I wanna save the world for (and let me love)
(Yeah)
And everyone that's still around gives me hope for tomorrow

So please don't be afraid to face what has taken up their lives to find a chance
If they're waiting for your hand to lift the weight on their shoulders, then it's time to take it away
That everything was always me until now, you could say, oh so fast
All my dreams begin come true, I hope they've helped by giving thanks to all the people who held onto their promises they had to make

We all can try hard to keep these moments we see and forget them when we close our eyes
Maybe life doesn't have as much meaning if we all just hold our breath
Like we used to, till our hearts were broken through so many years of love
In such a small space, it feels more like two empty hearts
Walking in the rain, tears streaming down our faces everyday with both hands in prayer
And we can find peace or some time to breathe

Until you have risen;

"Yea, we've seen the path of pain
Let me reach out my hand
You gave your love for me, you gave your faith for me"

You showed me a place, I would never fear

The sky is falling tonight (Tonight)
It’ll take me a little longer, before I find hope
Takes some time
But there is one thing (Oh God!)
Thank You for everything Your done for me
From fighting through hell to being born again
If only my strength could feel more
To see You here on Earth with all the people that were loved at Your hands

[Hook]
And a new beginning for us all
On the edge of destruction we find joy and peace
A new beginning for us all in this life

Verse 1
Life will feel so exciting when we find the right time to do it (We'll live)
All of our joy is here but we want everybody else (We'll be together)
Let them know, that no one cares about you until now (Until now)
But if they want what they wanted, then they always have to come home (Home)

Pre-Hook:
And when I talk to you, you won't be like me at all... (Like me at all...)

Hook:
And a new beginning for us all
On the edge of destruction we find joy and peace
We can start over!
When we find where we belong, oh lord (Ourselves)

Now let's say that I was only 18 years old....
If you don’t realize how much I see
The beauty of this world, you could go back to life with me

Verse 2

I hear people talk about how young kids, just tryin' to grow up, are born
When real adults show an attitude or look, that they ain't even know 'em

You just trying to be something, make the best out your mistakes.. yeah
But I'm already on top from work.. yea..
So my advice to anyone who wanna learn:.. stay humble..
Then teach people the real truth (Truth!)
It shows that every person has gotta give it all they have for their brothers and sisters around 'cause nobody else even can be a equal..

Because I see you right through it all, yeah

Verse 1:
And I don’t even need to say how much I care cause there’s hope in life if you understand that. But I ain’t gonna tell on your best night

But my hope is still worth the effort while you wait for me.
But baby I won’t be waiting around
Let alone on my lonely mind…in

Even though we are fighting everyday
We gotta keep running away if we wanna live any stronger

To stay together long enough to be on some brighter days

This is it right now we should really get on our own sometimes
Letting go lets just relax maybe together
For a better future where we will not end up living empty and shit
Forget the past it all hurts so much more every second
Ain't about who gon see us grow this side by side
The people who live with us all the same
Who are free when they’re at all
With the same problems that don’t exist
We could all start over like a sunflower
Cause if we let ourselves hate on each other then someday we’ll finally learn something new about love
And honestly I hope that everything we have is worth it
You know what else can we do? Let nothing change and love the other day

And what is there for us to do but hide?
And just because it's tough doesn't mean that we're gonna lose it (Don't you ever doubt it!)
Let it tear your whole life round like it’s a bullet wound
No matter how much pain it brings around me
This battle ain't gonna last forever (It ain't gon' end just like today!)
Love ain't a ticket out of a room you can hear or see
Our love is the key to our success
Loving something that really isn't meant for us only comes with time!
Ohhhh!! Love

And all the other days I felt lost, scared & ashamed, but I wanted someone who would make me whole.  When I thought you’d take my side, I had to leave you alone.

No time for waste where you need them from
Where you can be when you are stuck underneath another man's skin
You'll find the love that is still present but not forgotten
My whole life been filled with these feelings and emotions while looking around wondering how I had made each day come
And I don't think one single thing about it is what I was thinking or doing anyway (I know)

I heard some folks say it’s okay if you're blackin' or you came from a white background but that goes against reality and my own, right
And I gotta stay in touch with my roots here in my mother tongue like how can I grow when no one has heard of me? In this world we all play the race card sometimes so don’t be deceived
My family’s proud to raise all my brothers and sisters regardless cause no one wants to feel the pressure you put it on to make these streets look better. A different way to live cause if you only saw your daddy standing at the top of an African pyramid you would be saying nothing about getting respect but I got my own sense of purpose so don’t give up cause there’s only so many ways to be who we are

And you know life is for young minds it's beautiful if it turns out that's why we do it - You and I that was born into a whole new beginning
My hope is one day your legacy will pave your way to success
Because every time they take pride in not living a life they go and tell everyone that life could be brighter
Don’t believe them so don't try to change their mind or anything it doesn’t have to happen unless it seems right you already believed in it
Catch a wave keep your head above water and follow the flow until you become the man you once were and we ain't waiting for you to come save us somehow

I see the walls of my nightmares in this song
The words fill up like it has been in an unheeded call
Words make me scream and shake my head
When life is through, they are outta control
We say this because we need your light
The day I find out who I am
I hope that I don’t have to run away
Cause if we are alone there's nothing left for us
If we go home with you baby can hear those footsteps on the walls

Verse 1:
Don't tell me you’re sorry 'cause I just feel a certain way
I really get that feeling right when she opens her mouth at the sight of you walking through town
I know what I’m doing cause I’m here every day and night
Like how did we end up like this?
Baby maybe we should tell ourselves why we had to
Maybe time has come for a change
But it's hard not seeing how good time could turn into
Everything about me I swear to please you
In your body, on my mind I think of you everyday

Chorus:
There is no one to give this one last chance
There won’t be any tomorrow
No one to save us now
You are the only love that ever saved our day
I still wanna hold myself
Everywhere we go you make a promise we’ll make sure forever
Love will always save these kids from dying
Let them live and give the love that was born

Verse 2:
It makes me want to walk away
A dream comes true and then you leave again
And my eyes see a smile growing all around me
And all this pain makes me sick
To see you walking through town is something I never do
Sometimes I wonder if even I’m gonna be alive today

Aye, it’s that world I love the most
Where people come and they go but no one loves me this much
That’s why I came from the west to play
It's not because of what you say on Twitter or Facebook (No)
We all speak out and we try to do our best but now we're standing in this house alone (We are)
That's why when I stand right here with my head up high, it feels great being around ya guys
People want help just like nobody else can help us
Even if it ain't the government or some kind of thing, the people there help us too
I don't wanna be treated as a second-class citizen
The world should respect me even though they tried to tell me
Let’s make sure every kid knew his rights
There for him to have a chance to move forward but still they treat him like nothing at all
I just feel like I'm waiting for somebody to come to my life
It isn't hard cause I got nothing left to lose
But maybe next summer, I could make some money off this country
Well guess what? I just hope I can find myself a job and get me a new girl
In another couple of years I might find myself working in a field full of women
Somebody would really appreciate it if I made it right by these girls

Verse 1:
Sugar Daddy, can you handle yourself?
Caught up with the past
I've always been an asshole though my family never liked me
Families was so broken before we even met that didn't mean it to me at all, let's face it
It feels to be fucked when nothing lasts anymore
I know I got a lot to learn
And if nobody told me I wouldn’t get along, I guess they did
Life doesn’t make me anything but sad sometimes
I wish and wish for forgiveness of who I used to be
That’s my weakness
But people in my circle
They never saw the difference we made
How easy your heart hurt
Never knew you was worth saving after all you're doing
You don't deserve what you got now
What does it matter anyways? Didn’t realize how much I would have to bleed back into you before it’s over
What does it feel to be wronged by someone that wasn’t even there
The only thing I felt was shame? You deserved what you got instead of life!

In this world we call life and death as if God were playing guitar
My songs are more like hymn books and every day's a blessing but never the same

Open all directions (and the words to get through them you need), yeah

Forever! Never will

Verse 1: Xtreme
You came for the money and then you made it back
I don't know what to do but I just got caught up in my own shit, ain't no place for those that aren’t honest cuz life is hell on earth so let me tell you something
You said nothing to anyone and nothing to you at all
Now nobody’s giving a fuck why you tryna get the best of me
I know this man want to make some more money like i don’t have your back now
No not really
Cause I always thought about you when i was down by friends
And when we were dating i tried to get back to the old way
But if anything i had to quit being a man
Cause everybody loved me even though they knew i didn't deserve it (but)
Like why am i here with none of us
When people talk bout the people around us
I would take them out the house in my car and I'd walk up to the girls where they were from
I see the scars, Im sorry, well I hope that one day will get clear
If I could go back to school with everyone I grew up with
Why? Because I had a good friend who wouldn’t fall in love with her unless she’s blind or
She doesn’t understand how important her boyfriend is to her love life. She don’t need him cause his love is a blessing  And he loves her so I guess he can appreciate the fact that she has learned how to love herself
And I cannot ignore these feelings that are flooding inside me
Cause after all these years
I still remember our first date
And honestly, I didn’t think I’d ever give up , girl what the hell is going on oh lord
I can say that I regret getting into relationships before my time
Because the other guys in my life haven’t seen me coming through all that shit because lately I been feeling alone like..
Hate yourself you should live right outside
Cause I'm not gonna ever let you down again

So say goodbye in our bed or on your phone
Baby, we are not the same baby
There is no other choice baby, you don't exist
Wish I could tell you why, but I cannot lie to you

I know we used to hang out all day
But this was different before, I hope that time keeps moving along fine

Pre-verse:
The things that i could say were in doubt

We gotta work hard but there's no sense giving up
No matter how many ways
We must strive, keep on trying
Break down walls, make you smile at something
You know exactly what kind of man you are
That brings you back to life (oohh).

Can anyone tell me why you say such things? Do you think it is over now?
You know I don't care about you, so go on believe your dream and feel everything
And maybe every time you smile you make a beautiful face
Or maybe I like your voice so bad, I'm ashamed of something I can't speak
If a daydream gets me crazy, then maybe you should quit
Cause there was some other guy who got into trouble but didn't leave my side (yeah)
Now I get jealous everytime you see him, his eyes are evil as ever, he wants to fuck no more!
I don't need anyone else to take care of me cause I'm the only one that needs you

The Song Begins: "This is my own song, so sing it."

Pre-Chorus: "This is my own story, so we make a song. This song comes from us as you were singing, and then you write this song. So sing it. You don’t need to have this song on your mind, just know that your song will be the one you choose to use at hand (song)

Chorus:
Here’s how this song began:
A simple word, not like words, but all of these lines are words, so please say them out loud ‘cause we think more than every line is worth hearing
You made it through the storm, but we're still here; try again!"


Verse
We can be broken up at anytime.  We have everything.  What else matters?  What else would we need to say, or when we speak for granted? - Just keep it tight cause there ain't no one to hold ya down. And if you do fall, they say you deserve it. No matter what people say. 
Let you stand up strong, I'll stand tall as if I had something to say
Stand around and do your thing. When you don't, they say...
When you do, they said..


Bridge
If this was yesterday, you weren't gonna find someone better
(It's a different day, I won’t go crying out your name for days.)
But when it's today, you will hear another chorus that's louder than yours
And it just depends on who you listen to. Because if you don't have nothing to say and it needs some time away from you.....but if you listen hard enough, I swear it'll all get better.


VERSE
That brings me back to my childhood home.  When I was three years old, we started doing this song. Like "It is a dream," it’s our only goal now to take care of both ourselves and each other. We do this forever. So when we start doing it, remember that we love being together, and loving each other because this song is beautiful because this song is so beautiful. So, just sit back, enjoy the song and sing along....it will teach a lot about this song.  And if it hits you with such wonderful songs, believe me....you will see real peace throughout life.  And this song is very clear, like the whole world has an image of the heart (like mine......?) that goes on everywhere across the ages.  So enjoy the joy!

(My first verse was like so good) ‘Cause I’m a savage, you see how that works out? I’m trying to be a king if it ain't working for me. Don’t tell me this is where my heart will find it. ‘Cause when you’re living on the edge of your faith, you lose yourself and things start to change when you try so hard, I don’t know why.  It’s about what is right, not about what isn’t. (My first verse was like so good) The hardest part about this life, it won’t end til you learn to hate. I can’t imagine what would happen at any cost, and that makes me sick to my stomach because one day there’s nobody out here like me! And all these nights are just an empty dream—I get no love from anyone except me or my friends. It goes against everything!
Pre-Chorus:
Why put up with this fight?
Aww, you doin’ you wrong 'cause we made mistakes
You can let go of those bad days, oh baby

But I see now

Just stand by your head and watch what’s coming right between you and me

All I wanna say is
If we’re meant to end soon, will that last? Will either of us stop crying?
Will I try? How long before it happens?
Let me finish with your promise

I see you standing in the mirror with someone who doesn’t exist yet yeah
But nobody listens, because I am here to save everything!

Fell in love with you just at birth and now that we together
(Damn yeah) I feel that there was some time before my heart broke from its own shell
And a hole in my chest still don’t heal properly inside of me
So when all the times I needed things to be right let me down
But now that there is love and all they ever did was leave me alone
Gimme your loving heart every time I want someone
[Chorus]
You know that feeling where i love but don’t wanna miss you
Maybe if my heart broke then you’ll see me soon
And all these lonely nights around you are like a lifetime ago

When I’m with you, baby don’t break anything
Nothing wrong or right if it hurts you so much to hurt somebody (Yeah)
But if my heart breaks, baby don’t break anything
Just take your feelings and turn them into something more than a memory for a while
Don’t call nobody else but your lover and he’ll make you cry a little bit
He’ll bring you back in pieces because he’ll say that you were meant to be mine today

[Verse Two]
Running through my mind whenever I need someone real slow
Everytime we speak about our love it’s getting harder for me to breathe
So I'ma keep my feet out the clouds until you pull me back in when the air tightens out above

Letting go of all excuses that we’ve been holding on to
Tryna give myself a chance and I hope everybody agrees I’m fine
Until we fight and fight 'til we fall apart again
The ending is near, maybe we’ll find a better one
Or maybe I may have fallen asleep yesterday

And they found it wasn't real and he was crying because they wouldn't be there after the night

There will be an end tonight

In your mind, our dreams are reality
A dream of peace and love within
When you try so hard no one can see you fail
And everything that makes us happy ends up as bad as hell
But with the hope that you have, it doesn’t matter what you fight for

One thing at a time, two things at a time
Make each word count like God intended

Verse 1:
I been writing these bars for years now
I never thought a word would get this much real
With every bit of clarity it all boils down to something
To be sure, I’m not perfect
But at least I keep my eye on the prize
No we ain’t gotta go back what i said last night
Gotta stop believing that the world would change
I don’t wanna be stuck in my old ways
This life I love has always been me
I don’t wanna feel like nothing but pain
Never again will you let me go

Hook:
We gon' do our thing
Love it or leave it just as it
It depends on who you are and where you go

Chorus (X2):
They know how to be like the rest of us
As they talk this type of magic, oh woah, woa-oh yeah
I need y’all around me now because she's in my life now
Like a bird I just lost my wings now
I know we should all follow their lead now
Now these streets come running for you now that’s where I call home now
So I hop in my whip and put on my seatbelt today
My heart is beating so faster than the waves right now
And it feels like music and dreams collide again
It was written down somewhere in between them two but we're both getting older
Siblings have died and gone to heaven with no regrets now
And while our hearts are beating here at home
We keep our dreams up and close to perfect and hold on tight
Taste too much in love there ain't no other way
(Verse 1)
When I'm drunk on this painkiller girl you make me wanna go crazy
And when I got high in the summer when my knees hurting man I'd throw myself up in the clouds
Baby tell me what can you do? I think that I could use some help
Tell me the road gets easier everyday, get your eyes up in the sky, look out into space
Come closer baby girl just wait til my body turns blue
Then I'll give you my hand once again, tell me everything you want from me baby don't stop, listen!
And baby girl you take me higher every time that I dream
Wanna spend half of what people say I need more
But baby girl if they don't understand then they won't understand
Cause sometimes I feel like something just took control of not knowing
Or that someone really took control of making me numb
That's another thing that they never knew or maybe they could've seen right through me


Chorus (X4):
Uh, They know how to be like the rest of us
As they talk this type of magic, oh woah, woa-oh yeah
I need y’all around me now because she's in my life now

I know we should all follow her lead now
Now these streets come running for you now that’s where I call home now
So I hop in my whip and put on my seatbelt today
My heart is beating so faster than the waves right now
And it feels like music and dreams collide again
It was written down somewhere in between them two but we're both getting older
Siblings have died and went to heaven with no regrets now
And while our hearts are beating here at home

Reverse:
Torture, torture, torture
I am so tortured; my innocence tainted with shame (taste)
Wanna be the last one (the last one) left here; that’s what they think
They don't realize the truth behind my skin
Mental disorder is the most powerful way of explaining
The fact that the truth can bring us down for good and take our lives in our graves. A cold death
For all eternity!
Criminals must confess what is in their DNA – how are we supposed to believe it?
It's not real, what is written is written – nothing seems right in this world I live in
But why did we let these thugs do what they did? It’s easy to say: murder is a crime but it never will
What else can you do when your mind is full of fear?
Why did people in our society become criminals?  My name is Eshawty
Who the fuck do I serve today?  The streets’s just a joke?
A drug addict on crack; living life as a criminal in our own fucking system
And now I am the murderer while those who kill us want more money…


You want no respect...
You need to have dignity, integrity, and respect – your job
This whole process is a waste of time and resources for your own self interest
Why'd we end up like this ?!! Why we should take our bodies away
Our love should disappear and then you get back to being your old self!
You want something that’s real because there's nobody taking control
We were born into this nightmare and turned into a killer for fun – just to make them jealous and sell out our community
Now if you feel like you got everything that you wanted then go work it out with me!!!

There are better people up at home that will find the answer that i know, oh yeah I understand. (oh yeah)

VERSE 1 :  It’s just me and her
The whole crowd will never know what to say or do
Maybe now that our bodies are older (she is older)
Don’t make the same mistake again and again (this time it ends)
Can we both learn from it? Don’t forget it (maybe)
When we meet at our old place with a love so damn strong (in heaven we are)
We can be good together
That’s why this is why I let u come in
So let me give you a kiss on the lips (let me give you a kiss on your lips)
Lose control of yourself because you’ve got something
You really wanna feel something (yeah)
There’s a reason why not too soon
I keep my mind on everything (my brain)
VERSE 2 :  In some situations we don't mean it
Your words ain’t perfect but you tell yourself ‘bout it
It’s different everyday here
Some days you seem to have no intention anymore
But girl we’ll still meet up in the future
In other days might even go out and find something new
Saying the most is all we want right now
I hope that she gets to know him first before we leave here
I see we get closer, but we’re not meant to touch
We’rе more than friends, like we belong to somebody else
We were meant to each other
Then one by one, there was nothing better
It’s alright if he don’t help you down
Gon be alright as well
If he keeps taking away your heart from you
All his selfish stuff will fade
And nobody knows when it ends or how deep
Or the feeling inside of their hearts
That they couldn’t help with when it hits home
Just watch us grow. Just look into their eyes, yeah...

Ooh! He was so strong! He was so strong

Just to find out you think I’m too crazy
For someone so young

Verse 2: T.O.E
Yeah i've been waiting for this moment all my life since i walked in and touched your hand
Lying down hoping you're listening to a song about love
Cuz you got me thinking how special you see yourself in this world
Every single girl I try not to date anymore
Why'd they ask that questions when we could talk on the phone and spend forever?
Tryna make them move on me by making you mine
Even when she wasn't as friendly or kind as I used to be
How did i get these feelings inside
Didn’t mean to brag ‘bout sex but all of a sudden
You were loving me before I even knew
Ain’t even saying bye
Don't call back or text me back
Cause girl, you better go ahead and tell him that you don’t really like me anymore
Girl
Tell him you didn’t love me
Or maybe you should get an Fendi bikini
Or have a houseboat
Cause girl i feel like I don’t give a fuck why you’re asking me

Chorus: X2 Babygirl
He might cry sometimes
But everytime her heart sings
I'mma treat it like our time is through
When he's walking away from the door
All day long
In our favorite colour
I never ever felt so sad
Just to find out you think I’m too crazy
For someone so young

My first record of vocal misc was 'Trippin' With Myself.'

[2nd verse:]

[Verse 2:]

There's a lot more up inside of me than is known now, but you don't know
We got on our way to the top five
Let’s talk about money when we put together the tracks
Got you thinking bout how we built this track right into your heart
Your love story will always remain on memory
And so do you

It just has to be me! So much energy, so many people
Working hard to get to where they want it to be
With a little help from the fans, there's never gonna settle for nothing less! Just keep me focused on myself!!!

(Chorus):
Yeah, all the words going around us ain't working out
Everybody said, “we got a chance with this song.'”

(No I won’t be the one who takes this down like it should)
And every other night I still feel like that a lot
Every other person I miss and even on your birthday they’ve said everything is alright
The best way is out of sight when you look at me, that much I can say to be honest
But honestly, I think I gotta get you off my mind before the lights go out
Cause all I could do was just sit back and watch what happened to me
Like I ain’t got nothing left for me now but a different start
It ain’t over til it’s up again or it’s over till I’m broke with all my pride
To keep myself together all day as long as I hold out my hands
Or am I gonna see somebody new come and kill me? (A new life)
All these problems have never solved or made my whole world turn
I’m feeling so helpless yeah i lost control in a state where things are going wrong
Maybe my only goal is getting married but I really don’t wanna quit
You know how those days go for me
When everyone wants more than you
Then that time has come when we both realize
That it will not last forever baby (yea) oh that’s alright baby
Oh ya yea

Baby, do you remember us?
Do you remember us? Don't play no games

Cause he's better to you than most, that shit feels right baby
Dont go into all your feelings I wouldn’t be that surprised
Let Him love you until your heart goes numb (Yeah)
Take a sip my drink and take my energy away baby
Can't tell if you're loving me cause I thought maybe tonight
Now you'll get your chance you’ll forget what you did to me baby
Can't see that he lied and didn’t deserve you here with me babe
So hold me close then I move on (Right away)
I'm always looking back at all the times that i've wasted
I’m always working hard to live everyday
Keep my head above water just thinking about tomorrow
Cuz there's so many people in our lives that would give anything to make up
But they put work inside them, no matter what we try and do
I'm gonna be alright yeah

You're not around to change a thing

It's like now nobody needs one cause they already gone be with us
My name, my home and my baby girl, and I ain't playing games
I don't need no one else or for them to hate myself
But these things always happen when love is lost somehow
So when somebody cries your name I hope they understand you gotta stay strong
And if everything gets messed up then why would I ever cry again?
Cause life should be so difficult and all we wanna do, it's hard enough
If everything hurts, but when love is broken and nobody deserves to try to give you happiness then why can't everyone do anything for you? If you could see yourself through a dream
You could be perfect if you just do something right, cause everyday I feel it too! Love Is Your Dream

Even though I'm making beats I still feel like I'm just a kid now with a heart full of broken dreams and a smiley face in my eyes.

Just let yourself decide where you stand and just walk away because
Maybe sometime after this story they will tell the truth about how much they love to fuck up that real life
Either way
The whole world is gonna hate us just like last night that shit won't be easy
